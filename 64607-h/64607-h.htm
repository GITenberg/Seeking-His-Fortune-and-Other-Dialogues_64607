<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Nearly all the dialogues in the present collection were
originally contributed to a juvenile magazine in New York.
Many of them have been used at exhibitions in different
parts of the country, and met with a degree of favor
which has led to their publication in this more permanent
form. While intended for representation, it is hoped
that readers may find them a source of entertainment.</p>

<p>It is proper to add that only the first dialogue belongs
to me. The remainder are written by my sister, whose
name appears with mine on the title-page. So far as these
are concerned, my part has been merely that of an editor.</p>

moodily, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, with chair tipped back, and his hands in

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Jonathan.</span> Well, marm, I’ve made up my mind I
shan’t stay in Beanville any longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Peters.</span> Why, Jonathan, how you dew talk!
What’s got into you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I’ve got tired of Beanville, marm, that’s what’s
the matter. I aint goin’ to stay here all my life, raisin’
cabbages, and hoin’ taters. I’m fit for somethin’
better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. Peters</span> (<i>rousing from his nap</i>). What’s the
boy talkin’ about, mother?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I might as well tell you fust as last, dad. I’m
goin’ to Bostown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Massy sakes! Bostown’s a hundred miles
off. What you goin’ there for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> To make my fortin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> ’Taint so easy as you think for, Jonathan.
You’d a plaguy sight better stay round here and help
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I can’t do nothin’ here, dad. I have to work till
I get all tuckered out, just to make a livin’ and can’t
never wear anything better than overalls. Now, if I
was in the city, I could wear store clothes all the time,
like that are fellow that boarded up to the tavern last
summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I’m afraid, Jonathan, you’re gettin’
proud. You aint no call to be ashamed of wearin’
overalls. They’re what me and your father always
wear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> (<i>slily</i>). Yes, mother, you <i>do</i> wear the
breeches sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>in a deprecating tone</i>). Now, father, you’d
orter be ashamed. You know I didn’t mean that.
(<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Jonathan</span>.) I mean, Jonathan, your father and
me aint ashamed of wearin’ workin’ clothes. I’m afraid
you’re gettin’ proud, and pride’s a deadly sin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Can’t help it, marm. When that feller passed
me in the field last summer, he turned up his nose at
me, and I aint goin’ to stand it. I’m as good as he is,
any day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> So you be, Jonathan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> And I want, to dress as well. So I’ve made up
my mind to go to Bostown, and go into business there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> What sort of business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> As to that, I aint partic’lar. Anything that I
can make money by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> Perhaps you’ll lose it. They’re pooty
sharp in Bostown, I’ve heard tell. Most likely you’d
get cheated out of all you’ve got.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Yes, Jonathan, listen to what your dad
says; he’s had more experience than you hev.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> He don’t Know much about Bostown, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> (<i>complacently</i>). Yes, Jonathan, I know a
good deal about the city. I’ve been there three times.
Fust time was just after me and your mother was
married.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Thirty-one years ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> Yes, Almiry, thirty-one year. Then
again, I went down to sell a yoke of oxen for Squire
Peabody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> That time you had your pocket picked, and had
to borrow money to git home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> (<i>coughing</i>). Ahem! yes, I believe it was
that time. Then again, I went seven year ago, and
stayed to the Mechanics’ Fair. That are was a great
sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Well, dad, I haint never been at all, and I’m
goin’,—that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> You aint nothin’ but a boy, Jonathan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Aint I, though? I’m twenty-one year old, and
taller’n father, and I weighed myself down to the store,
yesterday, and weighed a hundred and eighty. I
should think I was old enough and big enough to be
trusted away from home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> The city is a wicked place, Jonathan.
Who knows but you’d get to drinkin’ and swearin’?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> There aint no danger of that, marm. I tasted
some whiskey, the other day, down to Hiram Johnson’s,
and it most turned my stummik. I shan’t drink anything
stronger’n cider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> That’s right, my son. Cider’s good, for
we know what it’s made of. Apples are healthy, and
when a body’s tired, a mug of cider goes to the right
spot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>). Yes, father, but you know
Sam Wilson got drunk on cider one town meetin’ day,
and smashed forty panes of glass in the meetin’-house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> Wal, wal, he drank more’n was good for
him. But, Jonathan, to come back to your plans, have
you thought what you shall do when you get to the
city?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Why, dad, I calc’late there must be plenty of
work to be did. I reckon I should like to tend in a
store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> Lazy business, Jonathan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> That’s what I like it for, dad. I’ve had hard
work enough, and I want to take it easy awhile.
Maybe I shall go into business on my own hook, if I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
get a good chance. There aint no reason why I
shouldn’t get rich as well as other folks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>hastily</i>). I hope, Jonathan, you aint goin’
to take that two hundred and fifty dollars out of the
Savings Bank, that yer Aunt Betsey give you in her
will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Of course I be. How can a feller go into business
without capital?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>solemnly</i>). You’ll lose every red cent of
it, take my word for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> And earn five times as much more, marm; I
guess I know how to make money as well as other
folks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Deacon, do say somethin’ to git him off
this foolish plan. He’ll fail, sartain, an’ it’ll make his
aunt rise from her grave, if he loses all the money that
she earned by knittin’ an’ dryin’ apples.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> (<i>reflectively</i>). I don’t know, Almiry, but
the boy might as well try his luck, seein’ he’s sot on it.
Perhaps he may do well, arter all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>delightedly</i>). That’s the talk, dad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Well, I dunno. It seems to me mighty
resky. However, if he must go, he’ll have to wait till
I’ve knit him some winter stockings. He’s most out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I kin buy some in Bostown, marm. They’ve got
plenty there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). And what are they
worth I should like to know? Boughten stockin’s
won’t stand any wear at all. Then, there’s your shirts;
you aint got but three.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Well, there’s enuff; I kin wear one a week, an’
three’s enough to shift with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. P.</span> You’ll have to be more partic’lar in the
city. I’ve heard that some folks in the city wear as
many as three clean shirts in a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> They must be awful dirty to need changin’
so often. But I guess, Jonathan, you’d better have
one more made.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Well, you kin send the shirt and the stockin’s
to me by express. I’ve made up my mind to go next
week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> An’ what’ll Mary Jane Parker say to that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I don’t care.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I thought you were sweet on her only a
little while ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Wal, she aint anything but a country gal.
Maybe I shall find a good-lookin’ city gal that’s got the
tin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> O Jonathan, I’m afeard you’re gittin’ vain.
“Vanity of vanity! All is vanity!” says the Scripters.
Mary Jane would make you a real capable wife.
She can make butter an’ cheese equal to any gal in
Beanville, an’ she made fifteen dollars, last summer,
sellin’ eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). What’s fifteen dollars?</p>

have you got?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I hed two hundred and fifty dollars when I left

board. I kin invest two hundred and twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. J.</span> (<i>aside</i>). That isn’t as much as I hoped, but

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Jones.</span> Well, Amanda, now that we have

next thing will be to fill it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amanda.</span> Advertise in the “Herald,” mamma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> It may be a good plan. We ought to make
money; but when I consider that we have a large rent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
to pay, I can’t help thinking that there is some risk
about it. You know we were able to live comfortably
on the money your poor father left, and without any
care or exertion on our part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> (<i>scornfully</i>). <i>Comfortably</i>, mamma! You know
how we had to pinch ourselves. I could hardly afford
one bonnet a year, and, as to dresses, I had to wear
them so long a time I was positively ashamed. Other
people make money by keeping boarders, and why can’t
we?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> You may be right, Amanda. But about
the advertisement. How shall we express it?</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Amanda</span> sits down at the table and writes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> How will this do, mamma? (<i>Reads.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wanted.</span>—A few first-class boarders, by a genteel
family whose object is to surround themselves by a
pleasant social circle, rather than to make money. Address
“Boarders,” Herald office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> But, my dear, my object is to make money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> Of course, mamma; but it sounds well to seem

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> To-morrow morning, probably, and we may expect
applications at any time afterward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Then it would be best to fix on a price for
board at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> Yes, I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> How would twelve dollars a week do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> It wouldn’t do at all. We couldn’t pay expenses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> But I’m afraid if we charge such high
prices we shall not be able to fill our rooms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> That’s just the means to accomplish it. Many
people judge of the style and reputation of a house by
the price asked. You ought to insist on at least fifteen
or twenty dollars for the best rooms, and a little less
for those not so desirable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> But that won’t correspond with the advertisement,
where I say I take boarders for company,
rather than to make money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> I don’t think that will ever be noticed; but if
it should, you can say with truth, that you could not
pay your expenses if you charged less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Well, I hope we may be successful, for I
have made such an outlay in fitting up the house, that
our income will this year be far less than usual, and
our expenses correspondingly larger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> There’s no doubt of our success. Three months
from now we shall be able not only to defray our necessary
expenses, but also to replace the money which you
were obliged to draw to pay for the furniture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> And I suppose we could have them at
whatever hour we chose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> That seems to be favorable. May I ask
your terms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> For my best rooms, with private meals, I
should be obliged to charge twenty dollars a week
apiece. If the meals came at unusual hours, it would
be worth more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>with emphasis</i>). Your charge is exorbitant.
Such accommodations are not worth more than
half the sum you name. Still I am willing to pay
twenty-five dollars for both of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I couldn’t think of such a thing. I shouldn’t
be able to pay my expenses at such low rates for board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I thought you didn’t keep boarders for
profit, but only for the sake of company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> That is very true. I don’t take boarders
for profit, but neither do I intend to take them at a
loss. I shouldn’t consider their company to be of sufficient
value to compensate for that.</p>

At the end of every month you will send in your bill to
me, and I shall pay it to you at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> That will be satisfactory. But what name
shall I put down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>with a courtly air</i>). Count Henri de Fripon,
madame. Here is my card. (<i>Passes it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> (<i>bows, while a pleased smile overspreads her
face</i>). And when would you like to come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> I shall come to you next Monday, in the morning.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
I have the honor to wish you good day, madame;

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> That’s a boarder after my own mind. He
never inquired the terms, and will be ready to pay when
the bill is presented. I wish we might secure others
of the same kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> And he’s one of the nobility, too. His presence
will give quite a distinguished air to the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Yes; he’s quite an acquisition. (<i>Bell
rings.</i>) Besides, who knows but—(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Miss Trist</span>,
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Trist.</span> Good mornin’, ma’am. Good mornin’,
miss. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> and <span class="smcap">A.</span> both bow.</i>) I’ve come to see
about gettin’ boarded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I think we can accommodate you. What
kind of a room would you like?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> It don’t make no sort o’ difference to me.
I only want a shelter. ’Taint likely I shall be spared
long to need one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> (<i>with sympathy</i>). Are you an invalid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> No, I aint sick yet, but there’s no knowin’
how soon I may be. My mother died <i>young</i>, and died
suddenly, too. I expect to go in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I hope not. (<i>A pause.</i>) We have rooms
which, with board, vary from twelve to twenty dollars
per week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> My sakes! That’s an awful price, aint it?
But then I might as well spend my money for board as
to leave it for my relations to quarrel over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> That certainly is a better way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> (<i>mournfully</i>). Perhaps you wouldn’t think
it, from my comin’ here to get boarded; but I’ve got
three sisters and two brothers, and they’re all watchin’
to see if I aint goin’ to get sick an’ die, so they can
have my money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> You’d better come here to board, then. I
dare say it would be the means of prolonging your life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Do you think so? I wish I could believe
it, though (<i>dismally</i>) I haint got nothin’ to live for.
But then, if I aint to live long, it would be a comfort
to spend my last days in peace. I’ve had a great many
troubles and trials in my time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I am sorry to hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Yes, I lost my best friend just six days before
we were to be married. If he’d only lived one
week longer, I might have been a desolate relict instead
of a lonely single woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> It must have been a great disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss T.</span> Yes; but then ’twas my luck. I don’t
place no dependence on anything now. (<i>Rising.</i>)
There’s no knowin’ what may happen; but I’ll come, to
stay, next Monday, if I’m alive an’ well.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> (<i>drawing a long breath</i>). Oh, I’m so glad she’s
gone. I hope something will happen to prevent her
coming. It’s as dismal to have her round as to be
alone in the house on a drizzly day in November.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> We can’t refuse any one who is willing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
pay our price. But hark! some one is coming. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Mr. Scott</span> hurriedly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Scott</span> (<i>nervously</i>). I have come to get boarded
here madam. (<i>With deprecating gesture.</i>) Don’t refuse
me, for I shall certainly commit suicide if you do.
You see I’ve set my heart on boarding with you and
your charming daughter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> (<i>benignantly</i>). There is no occasion for my
refusing you. We have still a few rooms left that are
not engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>in a hurried manner</i>). And what are your
terms—though that will make no difference. I shall
come, whatever they may be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> We have one room, at fifteen dollars, that
may perhaps suit you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>with a theatrical air</i>). Fifteen dollars! Ask
me not to pay such a paltry sum. I would never pay
less than twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Very well, you can pay any sum you
choose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Then I choose to pay twenty-five dollars.
But there’s another inquiry that I wish to make. Can
I have a piano in my room?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> There is a piano in the parlor, which
the boarders are at liberty to use when they feel
inclined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> But that will not suit me. Perhaps I should
wish to play when some one else was using it. No, I
must have one in my own room. (<i>Earnestly.</i>) I’m<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
willing to pay extra for it—five, fifteen, or even fifty
dollars a week, rather than not to have it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Certainly; if you are willing to pay for it
I will have one put into your room for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> You relieve my mind greatly. I will be
here to commence boarding to-morrow. Here is my card.

<p><span class="smcap">Jethro Burbank.</span> I’ve come to see as how, could I
get boarded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> We have some rooms still vacant, if the
price is such as to suit you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. B.</span> (<i>unheeding her remark</i>). You see, I’ve come
all the way from Hatchville, State of Maine, to see if I
could get a situation here in the city, and the fust thing
is to get a boarding-place. What do you calc’late to
charge me now? Don’t set it too high.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> The lowest-priced rooms we have left are
fifteen dollars per week, with board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. B.</span> Gewhittaker! That’s an all-fired big sum.
You don’t mean that’s your lowest price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Certainly. This is a first-class house, and
we do not take any boarders who can’t afford to pay
our prices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. B.</span> Wal, I don’t know what you call fust-class
boarders, but marm boards the schoolmaster, and the
editor of the paper, and I guess they aint second to
nobody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). And what does she charge for
board?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J. B.</span> Wal, she charges jest two dollars a week.
That’s what I call a reasonable price. But I knowed
that prices were higher in the city, and I calc’lated I’d
have to pay as much as five dollars; but to pay three
times that, is more than I can stand. Why, the price
of a year’s board would buy me a good farm down to
Hatchville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Then I’m afraid you’ll have to go back
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> No. We have several left. There are
two in particular that I think you would fancy. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
is a very large and pleasant room. The other is a little
smaller.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Oh, I must have the large one, by all
means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> The larger one, with board, will be twenty
dollars a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Very well, I will pay it. I’ve got plenty
of money at present. My husband died a year ago,
and left me with a large farm and a quantity of stock.
But I wasn’t going to be immured in a dismal farm-house—not
I. So I’ve sold the farm, and come to
the city to board till my money gives out. Perhaps
then you’ll take me as a partner in the boarding-house
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I find it takes considerable money, even
for that business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Oh, well, I’ve got enough—a couple of
hundred thousand dollars. But I’m not ready to go in
yet. I want to see a little of city life first. If I meet
a good-looking gentleman that invites me, perhaps I
shall become his partner instead of yours. But time
will show.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> What time would you like to commence?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> It might as well be now as any other
time. I can send for my trunks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Very well; I will show you the two rooms,

boarders would only pay up promptly. But Mrs. Westwood
and Miss Trist are the only ones that I can depend
on. The butcher and baker have sent in heavy
bills, and this morning I have received grocery and gas
bills, as well as bills for extra furniture that was required.
Then, too, a month’s rent is due for the piano
in the parlor and that in Mr. Scott’s room.</p>

an interview, and said that he had been disappointed

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> About five hundred dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Well, I’ve got a proposal to make to you.
In the first place, however, I must explain a little. Do
you remember hearing your husband speak of his sister,
Sarah Jane, who went to California to become a teacher,
some twenty odd years ago?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Yes; she went away just before I became
acquainted with him. He frequently spoke of the circumstance;
but the vessel was wrecked, and he supposed,
as he heard no further tidings, that she must
have been lost with the other passengers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Well, she wasn’t lost, but returned a
couple of months ago, and now stands before you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> And are you my Aunt Sarah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Yes. I went, as you know, to San Francisco
with the intention of teaching, but on board the
steamer I became acquainted with Mr. Westwood, who
had started for California to seek his fortune. He and
myself and one other passenger were the only persons
saved from the wreck. He persuaded me to abandon
my original plan, and marry him. I did so, and we
went into the country, where he bought a sheep ranch.
He was prospered in all his undertakings, and, last
year, died, leaving me, by will, all he possessed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> But why haven’t you written to us in all
these years?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> We were intending, from year to year, to
come back soon to surprise my brother, but circumstances
constantly arose to prevent it. After my husband<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
died, I determined to come at once and seek my
relatives; but when I arrived I learned of my brother’s
death. I then sought a boarding-place, and in looking
over the paper met with your advertisement. Although
the name was the same, I had no idea you were his
widow till I saw his portrait hanging in the parlor.
Though grown older, his features had not yet changed,
and I recognized him at once. I engaged board with
you, thinking if I enjoyed stopping here I would propose
to become a permanent member of your family.
I now propose to take the house, pay your debts and
all the future expenses of house-keeping, in return for
the society of yourself and daughter. What do you
say to the plan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> I should be very glad to have it so, but I
am afraid you do not realize what you are taking upon
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Trust me for that. I know what I am
about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. J.</span> Then there’ll be no more anxiety and worriment
about unpaid bills.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> And no desire to continue the experiment of
Keeping Genteel Boarders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>—<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint’s</span> sitting-room. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint</span>,
a tall, bony woman, with a sharp, pinched face,
is sitting in a rocking-chair, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, knitting.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint</span> (<i>soliloquizes</i>). I declare I’ll never
buy another thing at Thompson’s store. I paid fifteen
cents a yard for my last kaliker dress, and Mis’ Hobbs
bought one of a peddler yesterday, jest as good, for
thirteen cents and three quarters. It’s a shame! On
twelve yards I lost fifteen cents. That’s too much
money to lose in these hard times. I wish that
peddler would come along. I need a sight o’ things,
and if I couldn’t beat him down, my name aint Betsy
Jane Skinflint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p>(<i>A knock is heard at the door, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> rises and
opens it. The visitor proves to be <span class="smcap">Ezekiel Onthank</span>, a
Yankee peddler, with a large pack on his back. He
enters.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezekiel.</span> Mornin’, marm. Anything in my line
to-day? Dress-patterns, hoop-skirts, shawls, laces,
ribbons, jewelry, spectacles, buttons, scissors, needles,
pins—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Massy sakes! don’t tell any more of ’em.
I shall forget what you sed fust. You haint got no
good clocks, hev ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Haint I though! I kin beat everybody on
clocks. I’ve got some that cum clear from Switzerland.
I imported ’em myself. Here’s one (<i>taking it from his
pack</i>), the pootiest and best little timepiece ever you
see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Does it keep good time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> I guess it does—tip-top. It goes ahead of
anything ever you set your eyes on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>cautiously</i>). What d’ye charge for it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well, I hev been sellin’ on ’em
all along for twelve dollars apiece, but seein’ it’s you,
I’ll let you have it for ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>throwing up her hands</i>). Ten dollars!
D’ye think I’m made o’ money? Besides, the clock
aint wuth half that. But I don’t mind givin’ you five
for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> That don’t pay the cost of importin’ ’em;
but, ef you’re goin’ to buy consider’ble, I’ll say five
for it. What’s the next thing?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I want ter git a pair o’ spettercles. As I
was ridin’ to meetin’, last Sunday, mine fell off, and
the wheel run right over ’em, and smashed the glass
all to pieces. I cared more about ’em ’cause they’d
ben in the famerly so long. Marm and granny both
used ’em afore me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Mebbe they might be mended. Let’s see
’em.</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> produces a pair of heavy, iron-bowed spectacles.
<span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> looks at them dubiously.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> I s’pose they might be fixed, but it’s my
opinion ’twouldn’t pay. Besides, the bows are too
heavy to wear. Didn’t nobody ever tell ye that
wearin’ heavy-bowed specs sometimes made folks
round-shouldered?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>straightening up</i>). No. Dew tell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> But I’ve got somethin’ here that’ll suit you
to a T. Jest try ’em on (<i>handing her a pair of spectacles</i>).
That’s jest the article you want.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>trying them on and looking up</i>). Well,
they’re pooty fair. But I s’pose you’ll charge as much
as a dollar for ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> A dollar! Why, woman alive, you don’t
think I’d sell them specs for a dollar. They’re the
real genuine periscopic Scotch pebble. They’re well
wuth five dollars, but I shall only charge you three for
them. ’Taint often you can get such a good article so
cheap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I’ll give you two dollars for ’em.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> No, I can’t afford to sell ’em so low. But
I’ll tell you what I will do. I’ll split the difference,
and let you have ’em for two-fifty. They’re very
becomin’ to you—make you look ten years younger
than the others did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>smiling at the compliment</i>). Well, I s’pose
I shall have to take ’em. But I shouldn’t think
’twould take you long to get rich at that rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> The fact is, I’m growin’ poorer every day.
I ought not to sell my goods so cheap; but the
wimmen have such captivatin’ ways that I can’t resist
’em. What’s the next thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, I want some caliker for a new gown.
I bought enough for one at Thompson’s, the other day;
but I want another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> I’ve got jest the thing for you (<i>showing her
a piece of calico with stripes of red and yellow</i>). That’s
exactly your style, and it’s only twelve and a half
cents a yard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Will it wash?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Like white cloth. I’ve sold yards and yards
of that same pattern. It takes so well that one factory
don’t make nothin’ else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs S.</span> Twelve and a half cents a yard is too
much. I can’t afford it, but I’ll give you a dollar for
twelve yards.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Couldn’t do it. Think of a nice dress pattern
like that (<i>displaying the goods in a tempting
manner</i>) bein’ sold for a dollar. No, marm, I can’t
sell it any less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>looking at it longingly</i>). I’ll give you a
dollar and a quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Well, as you’re taking consider’ble, I’ll let
you have it for that; but you mustn’t say nothin’ about
it. Why, Mis’ Hobbs bought some of it, and paid full
price. I’m boardin’ there at Mis’ Hobbs’s. She’s got
a pooty daughter—that Sairy Jane. Between you
and me, that’s the reason I went to boardin’ there, for
Mis’ Hobbs aint much of a cook.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>elated</i>). I allers knew that. She never
did hev much of a bringin’ up (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> passes him
money.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> (<i>preparing to leave</i>). Thank ye, marm.
Well, aint there sumthin’ more? You’ll want some
hooks and eyes, and thread to make your dress with,
don’t ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, you’ll throw them in, won’t ye? The
store people do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> That’s askin’ a little too much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give
you a mince pie for ’em. I made some fresh ones
to-day. What d’ye say? You know yer boardin’-place
aint anything to boast of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Well, I don’t mind doin’ it for once. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs.
Skinflint</span> passes him pie from the table.</i>) But I think
I’d better be goin’. It don’t pay much to trade with you.
You’re a deal too sharp. (<i>Taking his pack, he leaves
the house.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>self-complacently soliloquizes</i>). I think I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
did make a good trade. Trust me for that. I saved
enough on them trades to buy me a set of furs, next
winter. They don’t cost but eight dollars, and I daresay
I could get ’em for five. But there, it’s most
twelve o’clock. I must be gettin’ dinner ready.</p>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>—<i>A curtain arranged from front to back,
dividing the stage into sitting-room, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and kitchen,
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, as both must be seen at once. There must be a
door between. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hobbs</span> is in the sitting-room,
sewing, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint</span> enters, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> How d’ye do, Mis’ Hobbs?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hobbs.</span> Why, how d’ye do, Mis’ Skinflint?
I’m glad to see you. Sit right down in the rockin’-chair,
do. (<i>She sits down, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) It’s a pleasant
evenin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, very pleasant. I cum over this
evenin’, Mis’ Hobbs, to see if there’s a peddler stoppin’
here. I bought a clock of one, this mornin’, and he
sed he boarded here. The clock don’t go, and I want
him to come and fix it, or give me another one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> Yes, that’s him; jest come into the
kitchen. He’ll be right in, I guess. He always sits
in here, evenin’s.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Just then voices are heard in the kitchen. <span class="smcap">Sarah
Jane</span> is seen knitting, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> enters, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Jane.</span> Well, what adventures have you had
to-day, ’Zekiel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> The richest was with Mis’ Skinflint. Mis’
Deacon Pettengill told me she was as mean as dirt
(<i>here <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> starts, but, on second thoughts, waits to
hear what is coming next. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hobbs</span> smiles, grimly</i>),
and I thought I see if I couldn’t sarcumvent her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. J.</span> What did you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> I offered her a clock for twelve dollars, and
she beat me down to five. I usually sell ’em for a
dollar and a half.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. J.</span> I suppose ’twasn’t worth even that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> It doesn’t go much, but when it does, it
makes up for lost time. Then she wanted some <i>spettercles</i>.
She took a pair for two dollars and a half that I
generally get seventy-five cents for; but I’ll warrant
they won’t magnify any too much, for there’s nothing
but winder-glass in ’em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>emphatically</i>). The villain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. J.</span> You was rather too bad, ’Zekiel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> Not at all. She bought some calico, and
asked if it would wash. I told her it would wash like
white cloth, and I guess ’twill. After two or three
washings, there won’t be a bit of color left in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, the wretch! Won’t I give it to him!
(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Hobbs</span> smiles. She evidently enjoys the scene.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> But the cream of the joke was that she
wanted some hooks and eyes and a spool of thread,
and gave me a mince pie for them. I tasted it, but it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
was such wretched stuff that I couldn’t eat it, so I
threw it into the river for the fishes.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint</span> dashes into the kitchen with arms
akimbo. <span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> shrinks back with mock terror. <span class="smcap">Sarah
Jane</span> and her mother come forward, smiling, to see what
will be done.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> What do you mean, you wretch, by cheatin’
me in such a way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> I didn’t cheat you. You tried to keep me
from gettin’ any profit on my goods. I put a price on
them, and you could take them or not, as you pleased.
You was willin’ to pay what I asked for them; so I
don’t see how I cheated you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> You didn’t tell me the truth about ’em
(<i>furiously</i>). Then you called the nice pie I gave you
wretched stuff. I shouldn’t ’a thought of givin’ it to
you ef ye hadn’t said you didn’t git anythin’ fit to eat
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> (<i>starting forward</i>). What’s that? What
did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>gloating over her discomfiture</i>). He said
you wasn’t much of a cook, and, ef it warn’t for
courtin’ Sairy Jane, he couldn’t stand it boardin’ here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Ezek.</span></i>). So that’s the way you repay
my kindness in taking you in, is it, you miserable
villain? I’m mad enough to pull your hair—if you
only had enough to pull.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ezek.</span> (<i>glancing sideways at her</i>). I shouldn’t dare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
to pull yours, marm, for fear ’twould come off in
my hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> (<i>advancing with a threatening air, and
catching up the tongs as she goes</i>). Get out of the
house, you insultin’ creature, and never let me set eyes
on you again!</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Ezekiel</span> goes out as if in fear, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, slyly beckoning to
<span class="smcap">Sarah Jane</span> to go too. She nods and goes out by
another door, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Hobbs</span> throws <span class="smcap">Ezekiel’s</span> pack
after him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. H.</span> (<i>going toward <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> with tongs upraised</i>).
Now, old Skinflint, do you go too. You’ve made mischief
enough here. I don’t blame the man for throwin’
your miserable pie away. I hope it wont pizen the
fishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>looking back as she goes out, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>). I guess
you’ll find you’ve got enough to look after, without
’tendin’ to your neighbors’ business (<i>pointing</i>). There
goes Sairy Jane with that peddler’s arm round her
waist.</p>

<p>(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mrs. Skinflint</span> from one door, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, while <span class="smcap">Mrs.

<p><span class="smcap">Frank.</span> Hallo, Charlie. In the land of dreams? If
so I won’t disturb you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles</span> (<i>not answering immediately</i>). Not exactly
dreaming. There was too much reality about my
thoughts for that. But sit down, Frank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>sitting down</i>). And what were you thinking
about, if I am allowed to ask?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> I was thinking what slaves we were to Fashion
and Mrs. Grundy. I don’t know of one of my acquaintances
who would have courage enough to do anything
which would conflict with the usages of so-called good
society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Don’t include me in that category. I have too
much independence to be subject to the dictation of
others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> You think so, my dear fellow; but you don’t
realize your own weakness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> On the contrary, I am confident of my strength,
and am willing to wager you one hundred dollars
against fifty that I will follow out any plan you may
promise to test my courage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> I accept the stakes, and feel sure of winning
them. Now what shall the plan be? Let me see.
(<i>Covers face with his hands for a moment—pauses.</i>) I
have it. Frank, you must tend a peanut and apple
stand in the Park for one whole day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>quickly</i>). I am willing to do it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>emphatically</i>). Remember, you must tend it the
whole day long, without absenting yourself for any
cause, except to take an hour for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I agree to that; nay, I will go further, and will
promise to dine at the stand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> When shall the trial take place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> As soon as possible, that you may know how well
I shall succeed. Let <i>to-morrow</i> be the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Very well; but there is to be one condition about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the matter. No one must suspect your reasons for
doing this, as, in that case, there would be no test at
all. If you even hint anything about it, you will lose
the wager.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I agree to that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Well, I’ll call round on you to-morrow, occasionally,

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O’Callahan</span> (<i>rising—with her knitting in her
hand</i>). Some peanuts, sir, or apples—nice apples
three cents apiece?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Murphy</span> (<i>wiping apples on apron</i>). Here’s where
you’ll find your nice apples—three cents apiece, and a
good deal bigger than the other woman’s.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>approaching <span class="smcap">Mrs. M.’s</span> stand</i>). What will you

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>regarding him attentively</i>). And what do

worth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> You’d better mind yer own business,
O’Callahan. There comes a boy that wants an apple
maybe. (<i>Boy comes in, looks at apples and passes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> You’ll have to tell me how you sell the things.
I don’t know anything about the prices.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> The apples are three cents apiece. Some
of the peaches are three cents, and some two cents, and
them bananas are ten cents apiece. If you sell a dozen
of ’em at once, you’ll sell at a little less price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> That’ll do. I guess I shall get along well now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>interested.</i>) No. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> He is hopelessly insane.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> That is very sad. But what was the
cause?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Overwork, I believe. Is it not so, Mrs.
Wheeler?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> That is the report, and it is said his wife
doesn’t dare to be alone with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I heard that, yesterday, he jumped from
a window in the second story, and injured himself very
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> How shocking!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> He said he intended to kill himself, and
was sorry he didn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> No wonder his wife feels timid. I dare
say he will make another attempt at suicide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> There’s no doubt of it. In fact he told
his wife so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> He has threatened her life too; several
times I believe. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> in significant tone.</i>) By
the way, Mrs. Burley, is <i>your</i> husband well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>startled</i>). Certainly. But why do you
ask?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, I merely inquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> But you had some motive in asking. What
was it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Tell her, Mrs. Wheeler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. W.</span> Oh, it’s nothing I dare say. Still, some
things look a little singular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). Pray explain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Was your husband at home to dinner to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> No, he said he should be too busy, and
would dine down-town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> He didn’t state the nature of his business,
did he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> No, but I supposed he was detained at the
store. Do you know anything of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes; he’s been tending an apple-stand all
day to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>surprised</i>). It cannot be. You are surely
mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Not at all. It has been the town talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>meditatively</i>). It is very strange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Insanity is not hereditary in your husband’s
family, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Oh, no; and yet—let me see. Yes, I am
sure he told me that his grandfather died insane. But
Frank never could be in such a state. He has too
strong a mind for that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Still, you can’t help thinking it is a little
singular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> Ye—es. But I cannot credit it. It seems
impossible.</p>

me. I am too nervous to go alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> We are willing to accompany you. Is it
not so, Mrs. Wheeler?</p>

is evidently insane.</p>

merchant like him, to tend an apple-stand! But what
shall I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> I don’t know. This is probably the first
stage of the disease. I’m afraid he may become
violent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Would you advise me to arrest him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> (<i>whose thoughts revert to <span class="smcap">Mr. Walters</span></i>). I
am so distressed I hardly know; but it seems as if he
ought to be prevented from doing any mischief.
Perhaps it would be better to do so. That would bring
matters to a crisis, and we should know the worst.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Stop. First tell me what all this means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Certainly. No gentleman in your position would
think of leaving his business and tending an apple-stand
if he was in his right mind. So I have put on these
bracelets to prevent your doing any violence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Ha, ha, ha! “So fades my dreams!”
Goodenow, you must give me credit for sustaining my
part of the agreement, as far as I alone am concerned.
But circumstances have conspired against me. (<i>Turning
to his wife.</i>) My friend and myself laid a wager
that I had not sufficient courage to tend an apple-stand
one whole day without giving any explanation thereof.
In attempting to do this it seems I have laid myself under
suspicion of being insane. I therefore abdicate in
favor of Mrs. Bridget Murphy, trusting she may find
the position a pleasant and more lucrative one than I
have done. (<i>He comes forward and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Murphy</span>
enters and takes his place.</i>) Henceforth, like a dutiful
subject, I will restrain all improper inclinations, and
confess that, like my friends and neighbors, I, too, am
a slave of Mrs. Grundy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrie</span> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). So Mrs. Montgomery’s
nephew is coming to-day. I hope he is agreeable. I
wonder if he is engaged. It must be nice to marry a
rich man, and live in the city, and go to balls, parties,
and the theatre. I don’t understand why Mrs. Montgomery
doesn’t feel so. She married a merchant, and
can live in fine style in the city, but yet she prefers the
country. And to-day her nephew is coming here. He
thinks people on a farm are countrified, but I guess we
can show him they are not all so. I’ve a good mind to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
flirt with him a little, by way of variety. I don’t
believe it would be very difficult to captivate him.
Perhaps, I can teach him a lesson. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Herbert</span>,

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> What inducement have you to offer?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> A ride home on the hay after it is put into the
wagon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> That might be sufficient sometimes, but not
now, for I must hurry home. Do you know, Herbert,
we are to have a new-comer at our house, this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> No. Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Mrs. Montgomery’s nephew. Adolphus Fitz-William
is his name, I believe. His aunt says he has
never been in the country at all, and he thinks farmers’
families are countrified to the last degree. She has his
picture, and it looks very foppish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> And he is coming to-day, is he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> Yes; he’s expected in the first afternoon train,
and it’s about time for that to be here. (<i>Hears a step,

<p>“My dearest One: This is St. Valentine’s,
the day when every person is privileged to write
tender epistles to their loved ones. So I have seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
myself to write to you. I did think of asking you a
question which my past attentions have, no doubt, led
you to expect. But, on second thoughts, I have concluded

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> (<i>laying valentine on table, sits back in chair,

I’m sure it couldn’t come from anybody but Obadiah
Rakestraw. His mother’s just died, and he used to go
to singing school with me when I was a girl (<i>complacently</i>),
and he’ll be here to-night. I guess I’ll go
and fix up a little, as long as he’s sent me word he’s
coming.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">A. H.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> Enter <span class="smcap">Carrie</span> by same

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). Oh, dear, how unhappy I am!
it is six months since Herbert went away, and I know
it was because he thought I liked that popinjay
Adolphus. Of course, he doesn’t know that it was
nothing but a flirtation, and that I couldn’t endure the
sight of Adolphus afterwards. I didn’t think Herbert
would have gone off so suddenly, without even writing
me a note to say he was going. Six months ago, and
I’ve been so miserable all this weary time! (<i>Suddenly
sees the letter.</i>) What’s this, a valentine, addressed to
Miss Leland? Why, that’s my name, and, of course,
I have a right to read it. (<i>Opens it, and notices contents.</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Yes, it was intended for me, and is in Herbert’s
handwriting (<i>joyfully</i>), and he is to be here this
evening! But how came it opened? (<i>With sudden
thought.</i>) It must be that Aunt Hannah has opened and
read it, thinking it was intended for her. I guess I’ll
place the letter where I found it (<i>lays it down</i>), and
leave the room till the time comes for Herbert to
arrive.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Carrie</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and enter <span class="smcap">Caleb</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal.</span> Well, that’s pretty treatment, for Aunt Hannah
to go off when I told her partic’larly I was coming right
back; and most likely she has carried the valentine
with her. (<i>Looking round, his gaze falls on the letter.</i>)
No, she hasn’t, either. By George! she was quite
good, for her. (<i>Takes letter, which he opens and reads.
Looks up with ludicrous expression.</i>) So Aunt Hannah
has really got a beau! Who can he be? I guess he
don’t know her as well as some folks do. Let’s see
(<i>Consulting the letter.</i>) He’s coming here to-night to
ask her that question. It’ll be worth a great deal to
see anybody making love to Aunt Hannah. How can
I manage to be round to see how it’s done? (<i>Looks
around.</i>) Oh, this is just the thing. (<i>Goes behind a
curtain, which he draws, thereby concealing himself.
<span class="smcap">A. H.</span>, dressed in black silk and wearing a gay headdress,
enters, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> (<i>taking letter, which she puts in her pocket</i>).
Well, there, I was rather ventur’som in leaving this
valentine on the table. It’s a wonder that Calup
didn’t come in an’ get hold of it. If he had, I’d never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
have heard the last of it. (<i>A knock at the door, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>
<span class="smcap">A. H.</span> opens it, and ushers in <span class="smcap">Obadiah Rakestraw.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> Good evening, Mr. Rakestraw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obadiah Rakestraw.</span> Good-evening, Miss Leland.
So you’re all alone this evening. (<i>They sit down with
their backs to <span class="smcap">Caleb’s</span> place of concealment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> Yes, I happen to be just now, but I suppose
the rest of the folks will be in soon. (<i>Aside.</i>) I
wonder if he won’t take the hint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal.</span> (<i>aside.</i>) Oh, my! aint she sly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> I thought I’d just come in and make a neighborly

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> Oh, you’re too shy. There’s nothin’ like

time like the present. All ye’ve got to do is jest ask
the question. I’ll warrant you’ll get a favorable
answer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal.</span> (<i>aside</i>). Don’t she drive business?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> Wall, I’ve a good mind to take your advice.
As you say, ’tis kind o’ lonesome, an’ I can’t more’n
get refused (<i>rising</i>); so I’ll jest go over an’ ask Hitty
Trumbull if she’ll marry me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> That’s jest what I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> Well, it’s downright dishonorable treatment,
after the letter you sent me to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> (<i>surprised</i>). I haven’t sent you any letter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> (<i>taking it from pocket</i>). Didn’t you write that
valentine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> (<i>glancing over it</i>). I never saw it before; and,
between you and me, I don’t think it was intended for
you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> Do you mean to insult me by saying I open
other folks’ letters?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> Not exactly, but I think this was written to
your niece. It aint the kind o’ valentine one would be
likely to send to a person of your age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. H.</span> (<i>in a high tone</i>). You mean to twit me about
my age, do you? I’ll just let you know that I’m six
years younger than Mehitable Trumbull. But I won’t
listen to any more of your insultin’ remarks; so just
leave this house, or I’ll call somebody to help you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">O. R.</span> It’s lucky I didn’t offer to marry you, as you
asked me to. I see your temper hasn’t improved any
since we used to go to singing-school together.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">O. R.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">A. H.</span>, almost frantic, paces back and forth.</i>)</p>

her love should be refused. (<i>Voices outside.</i>) But
who’s that? Perhaps, she’s coming back again. She

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> I don’t know, I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal.</span> (<i>peeping out, aside</i>). I know all about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> But you haven’t answered the question it
contained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>demurely</i>). Did it contain one? I thought
the note said you intended to ask a question; but, as
you didn’t do so, I supposed you’d changed your
mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> You needn’t pretend ignorance. I can’t propose
with the same grace that Adolphus did, but you
can’t help knowing that I meant to ask you to marry
me. (<i>Taking her hand.</i>) Will you be my wife,
Carrie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Car.</span> (<i>archly</i>). I suppose it wouldn’t do to say anything
but “Yes,” especially as, if I refuse, I couldn’t
return your letter, since Aunt Hannah has taken
possession of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> I shouldn’t be satisfied with any other answer.
Now, let’s go and tell your mother about it, and then
we’ll set the wedding day.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt, arm in arm.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cal.</span> (<i>coming forward</i>). Well that was a little addition
I didn’t expect. I’ve always wondered how folks
popped the question, but I’ve found out all about it,
and now I can do it like a book. I guess I’ll go down
and see ’Lizy Blake before I forget how it’s done. If
she says “Yes” we’ll have a loaf of wedding-cake as
big as our new school-house. (<i>With sudden thought</i>) I
don’t know though, but I ought to write a valentine,
and send to her, first, to let her know I’m coming.
That’s the way Herbert did. But then, just as likely as
not, her aunt Lizy’d get it, thinking ’twas for her.
She’s cross-eyed, an’ wears false hair an’ store teeth,
an’ I couldn’t have her on my hands. No, I guess I’ll
go right down, an’ do my sparkin’ in good style, an’
wind up by askin’ ’Lizy if <i>I</i> shan’t be her Valentine.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bliss</span> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). Sixty years old to-day!
Well, well, how time passes! It seems but yesterday
since I was a lad, going to school, and making love to
the girls, instead of studying the lessons which Master
Winthrop gave out. It seems strange how persons
change as they grow older. Then, I was a favorite
with the girls, and always escorted one or more to every
party, husking, or apple-bee. Now, when called upon
to entertain a marriageable person of the other sex, I’m
thrown into a decided flutter. It’s ridiculous for one of
my age and experience, but still it is a lamentable fact.
There was Minnie Warren, a blue-eyed little fairy to
whom I got very much attached; in tact, we were engaged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
I believe if she hadn’t left Cherryville as she
did, I should have finally married her. I was indignant
enough when I heard that her father had bought the
Union Mills, and the family were going to leave town.
She finally married, I heard, and made some man happy.
(<i>A pause.</i>) Well, some say every one has their share
of good and ill fortune; but the fact is, I believe that
some are fated to be happy, and some to be miserable
in this world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>entering, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>). Hallo, uncle; have you got the
blues? What right have you to talk about being miserable—you,
who have everything that wealth can
procure to make you happy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I know I have everything comfortable here,
but the fact is, Dick, I’m lonely in this great house.
You, who pass most of your time in a store, with people
constantly coming and going, take pleasure in spending
a week or two in a quiet place, and among new scenes;
but there’s no novelty in it to me, who have lived
here for twenty years with no one in the house but
servants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> It must be rather lonesome to live here all the
time (<i>glancing furtively at his companion</i>). I expect
you’ll be marrying one of these days, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I might have done so once, but it’s too late
now. I’ve got settled down in my bachelor ways, and
cannot depart from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>mischievously</i>). You may be forced to depart
from them, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). What do you mean, Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> You remember the widow Payne, that we have
met several times lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>interested</i>). Yes. What of her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> She has been heard to express a very favorable
opinion of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> That amounts to nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> But you know that this is leap year, when ladies
are privileged to propose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>startled</i>). But you don’t think she would do
such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>solemnly</i>). It is impossible to say. She is a
widow, and you know the race of men has been warned,
by an astute observer of human nature, to beware of
that class of humanity. If she has any sympathy with
the “Woman’s Rights” movement, I’m afraid you’re
fated, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I couldn’t stand that. But what shall I do,
Dick? Leave town?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> There wouldn’t be any use in that, unless you
staid away the remainder of the year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>nervously</i>). I couldn’t do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Then be courageous and bear it like a man.
Of course you’d refuse the honor (<i>questioningly</i>)?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Of course I should. I wouldn’t accept
under any consideration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Then that’s all settled. But if you should get
into any kind of a scrape, just let me know, and I’ll
get you out of it—trust me, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B</span>. Well, I think I will. No doubt you know
more about those things than I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I dare say I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>rising</i>). Well, I must go and take my
morning walk. Will you go too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>rising</i>). Yes; where shall we go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> We might as well go and call on the widow,
and take a survey of the situation, as I don’t mean to
be entrapped by any of her wiles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>sharply scrutinizing <span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span>—aside</i>). I must
look out for this uncle of mine. He may himself propose
to the widow, instead of her proposing to him,
and that would be death to my prospects. I must look
out and not lose the property. (<i>Takes out a couple of
cigars, which he offers to his uncle.—Aloud.</i>) Have a
cigar, uncle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span>—Thank you, I don’t care if I do. (<i>Takes
one.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I haven’t seen you at our house for several
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>nervously</i>). No—I—have been very busy
and couldn’t come, but have thought of you, and meant
to come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> So you have thought of me. I am glad of
that. I have thought of you, also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>startled</i>). Ah! Th—thank you, but—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). I dare say you couldn’t
guess my errand to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>nervously</i>). Oh—no, of course not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> I have long loved you, and have felt certain
that I was not disagreeable to you—and, knowing
your timidity, I have availed myself of the privileges
of Leap Year to come and offer myself to you. (<i>Rises
and throws her arms around his neck.</i>) Hiram, I love
you,—do you reciprocate my affection?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>almost overpowered, and looking around,

is so sudden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> It may be sudden—and yet why delay our
happiness? (<i>Her head droops on his shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I—I need time to consider (<i>a sound of approaching
footsteps is heard</i>)—I—I must go—let me
go. I have an engagement at nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Then give your consent to our marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>struggling frantically to free himself</i>). I
cannot—I—(<i>a sound is heard as of a person at the
door</i>). Let me go—let me go—(<i>in an imploring tone</i>)
quick—somebody’s coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Say yes, then, dearest Hiram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>in an agony of fear</i>). Yes, yes—anything,
if you will only leave me. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> imprints an audible
kiss upon his forehead and turns to leave the room. Apparently
by mistake she grasps the bell-knob and pulls it

<p><span class="smcap">S.</span> That’s strange. The bell rang distinctly, and so
loud that I thought you was in a hurry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Well, it’s of no consequence. I don’t need
anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>pacing the room and soliloquizing</i>). What
have I done? Engaged myself to this widow, notwithstanding
all my resolutions to the contrary. But
something must be done about it. What shall it be?
I might leave town—but that would be cowardly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Besides, I shouldn’t want to shut up the house. I might
write, saying I had changed my mind; but I’m afraid
that wouldn’t be just the thing. (<i>Paces back and forth
a few moments without speaking.</i>) The fact is, I shall
be obliged to marry the widow. There seems to be no
other way left me, after giving my promise to her. But
I won’t say a word to Dick about it. (<i>A pause.</i>) After
all, I might do a worse thing. She would be a credit
to my establishment, and the presence of a woman
<i>would</i> brighten up the house. I guess I must go there
in the morning and talk the matter over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>casting down her eyes</i>). I am sorry to dispute
you, but I had a severe headache last evening, and
did not leave the house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>in a disappointed tone</i>). Is that so? But
certainly some one bearing your semblance called on
me last evening. (<i>A pause.</i>) It must have been one
of Dick’s harum-scarum tricks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>fidgeting nervously</i>). Couldn’t we make my
vision of last evening a reality?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Possibly we might, if you desired it very
much. But I’m afraid you haven’t counted the cost.
You have been a bachelor so long, that you might soon
tire of a wife, and consider her an intruder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> I am satisfied it would not be so. Besides
it seems as if I had known you before; where can I
have met you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Why, don’t you remember? I knew you
at once—I was formerly Minnie Warren.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Then I claim you by right of an engagement
made between us forty-six years ago—when you
were twelve and I was fourteen. Have you forgotten
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> Oh, no, I remember it perfectly well; and
how I cried when we left town because you could not
go too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>drawing his chair nearer and placing his arm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
around her</i>). There is a good deal of change in the
age and size of your lover as he was and as he is.
Are you not afraid of repenting if you should marry
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. P.</span> (<i>archly</i>). Oh, no. It is a good trade to exchange
a little Payne for a greater bliss. I am satisfied
as far as I am concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>entering, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>). Hallo! What’s all this? I’m
afraid I’m intruding. (<i>Looks anxiously at his companions.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> Not at all. Allow me to present you to
your future aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick</span> (<i>bowing low—aside</i>). There’s my inheritance
gone to the dogs, and by my own act. (<i>Aloud to
uncle.</i>) This is something new, isn’t it? How did it
all come about?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. B.</span> (<i>significantly</i>). I had a leap-year vision last

the sound of the piano, look toward it to discover the

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Evelyn</span> (<i>sternly</i>). What does all this mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">K.</span> (<i>Darting a withering glance at the speaker, and

offended.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss E.</span> But who gave you leave to deck yourself

<p><span class="smcap">K.</span> Sure I was only airin’ the dress, ma’am, as it

<p><span class="smcap">Miss E.</span> Well, I don’t approve of any such airs.
Leave the room, every one of you! The idea of my

You will all receive your discharge to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>(<i>The servants leave the room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, looking crestfallen

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>aside to <span class="smcap">Ann</span>, who goes out last</i>). An’ aint
we goin’ to have our trate then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> (<i>aside</i>). Whist! Yis. Say nothin’. We’re
goin’ to have it right away. Miss Evelyn never comes
down below at this time o’ night.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss E.</span> (<i>seating herself <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> in disgust</i>). Was there ever
any annoyance equal to that of keeping servants?
Mine are a constant source of trouble. I have
threatened to discharge them all to-morrow morning.
But what shall I gain by it? I shall have another set
who will perhaps try my patience even more than these
have done. Servants understand their importance, and
realize their power over their employers. It is becoming
a species of tyranny. If I could only do without
them I most assuredly would do so. (<i>A shout of
laughter is heard in the distance. <span class="smcap">Miss E.</span> stands up.</i>)
What! haven’t they done yet? Probably they are gormandizing,
downstairs, at my expense. (<i>To the audience—a
little sarcastically:</i>) I have heard some persons
wish for wealth, so that they could afford to keep
servants to wait on them. They do not realize the
emptiness of their desires. A person who has few
wants, and can minister to them himself, is more independent
than the wealthiest person living. Those who
keep a multitude of servants are dependent on <i>their
whims</i>, and should not be surprised at frequent outbursts
of High Life Below Stairs.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montgomery.</span> Mr. Montgomery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Montgomery.</span> Well, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> We must go into the country this summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Is it absolutely essential to your happiness?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>with suppressed eagerness</i>). Of course I
should enjoy it very much. But I wasn’t thinking of
myself. The children need it far more than I do. They
are both quite feeble and need fresh air and country
living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> I hadn’t noticed that the children were not
as well as usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> No, I dare say not. Men never notice
such things. But they are both ailing; and if I didn’t
doctor them all the time, they’d be down sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> We can’t afford to pay the extravagant
prices charged for country board.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> I don’t expect to go to a fashionable place.
But we might get boarded, at a low rate, at some farm-house
where we could get fresh fruits and vegetables,
and those things which can only be found in the country.
I’m sure it’s better to pay one’s money for such things
than to spend it for medicine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> The sea-breeze is better than the country
air. You might take a trip with the children to Hingham
or Nahant once or twice a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>slightly ruffled</i>). How foolishly you talk!
But then it’s what I might expect. These short trips
always fatigue people more than they benefit them.
When it’s too late to help the children, perhaps you’ll
think of my advice and wish you’d followed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> If it’s as serious a matter as you suppose,
and this is the only remedy, I should say go, by all
means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> You must judge for yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> But I don’t believe it is possible to find
such a place as would suit you at a reasonable price.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). I found an advertisement in
last week’s paper describing a place that I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
would be just such us we would like. Here it is.
(<i>Takes paper from table—reads.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Country Boarding.</span>—Those who are leaving behind
them the noise and dust of the city, and wish to refresh
themselves by a communion with nature, will find a desirable
summer retreat at Honeysuckle Villa, in the
beautiful town of Hillsdale. It is within five minutes’
walk of the railroad, in the midst of a country rich in
vegetation, and smiling under the liberal eye of a
bountiful Providence. A beautiful lake, at the distance
of a quarter of a mile, presents strong attractions for
the angler, while a boat which has recently been placed
upon it will enable the visitor to enjoy the luxury of a
sail. No pains will be spared to render this a delightful
retreat for the denizens of the metropolis.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Eliphalet Jones.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> That sounds well enough. But what proof
have you that things are as represented?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> I wrote to Mr. Jones, and received a very
gentlemanly reply. As he says, the terms are quite
moderate. Mrs. Livingston pays nearly twice as
much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> What are the terms?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Thirty dollars per week for you, myself,
and the two children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> But are there trains at hours to accommodate
me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Yes, I took pains to ascertain that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> Very well, then, make whatever arrangements
you choose. We can but give it a trial.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>). That’s one point gained.
The next thing is to make preparations for our journey.
I was determined not to be cooped up in the city another
summer, when all our acquaintances are boarding in
the country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> That’s the kerridge that’s come for ye, anyway.
Mr. Jones thought mebbe you’d hev a lot of baggage,
so he sent the hay-riggin’.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> But there are no seats.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Yes, there’s a board to put across, after we get
loaded up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). And we are expected to ride
in such a vehicle as that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> There aint no use in callin’ it names. It’s easy
enough ridin’ in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> But we cannot all sit on one seat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> The children can set on the trunks. (<i>Takes up
one of the trunks to carry it out. Exit, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">George.</span> Say, mother, have we got to ride in that
old, ricketty wagon? It’ll jolt like everything, I know
’twill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>in a soothing tone</i>). We’ve only got to ride
a few steps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>entering</i>). Don’t know ’bout that. I reckon it’s
a good mile down there, and the roads aint none of the
best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Mr. Jones’ advertisement
stated that his house was only five minutes’ walk from
the station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Mr. Jones got the schoolmaster to write that
notice for the paper. He came up to the house one
night and did it. Jones told him to put it in pretty
strong. The marster read it out ’loud after he’d writ it,
an’ I declair to goodness, I shouldn’t ha’ knowed ’twas

<p><span class="smcap">Scene IV.</span>—<i>Sitting-room. <span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> present, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> I can’t stand boarding here much longer,
that’s a fixed fact. Mrs. Jones sets a most wretched
table, and the children are really growing thinner every
day. If it hadn’t been for the name of it I should have
left Hillsdale before this. The reputation of going to
the country for the summer is hardly sufficient to pay
for living in small rooms, sleeping on stifling feather-beds,
and enduring such execrable cookery, and not a
book but the Farmer’s Almanac to be found in the
house.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Florence</span> runs in <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, with a terrified expression of
countenance. Her hat is hanging down from her neck,
and her hair flying in all directions.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flor.</span> Oh! oh! I’m so scared. (<i>Runs to her
mother.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Why, Florence Malvina, what a fright you
make of yourself! Pray what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flor.</span> I guess you’d be frightened if you’d been
where I was. I just went outside of the road to find
some blackberries, when I thought I heard somebody
coming. I looked round, and there was a great ugly-looking
cow running after me. I ran as fast us I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
till I couldn’t go any further, and then I crept
underneath the bars, and came up through the field.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> It’s a shame for people to allow their cows
to run around the streets in such a way. It’s lucky that
you were not killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flor.</span> The cow would have taken me up on
her horns if she had caught me, I know she would.
She held her head down all ready to do it. (<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">George</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, covered with mud and water</i>). Why
George, did you almost get drowned? Just look,
mother. George is just as wet as he can be. (<i><span class="smcap">George</span>
looks askance at his mother, but says nothing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>severely</i>). Well, George Alexander, this
is a pretty plight for you to be in. What have you
been doing now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geo.</span> (<i>defiantly</i>). I wasn’t doing anything, only
building a dam down by the spring, and pretty soon
some boys came along, and they laughed at me, and
said they bet I couldn’t jump the ditch there. So I
meant to show them I could, and I did do it too; but
the ground was all soft and wet the other side, and
when I tried to jump back again I fell into the ditch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> What boys were they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geo.</span> The Dunn boys. They knew it was wet the
other side, and when I fell in, you ought to have heard
them laugh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> They are nothing but ill-bred country
blockheads. (<i>To <span class="smcap">George</span>.</i>) But don’t stand there any
longer with those wet clothes on. Go and change them
at once.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">George</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Florence</span> follows him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>sola</i>). What a wretched place this is! If
I was obliged to live in such a way at home, I shouldn’t
think I could bear it. The family here haven’t even
<i>decent</i> accommodations for keeping boarders.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Enter
<span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, in state of great excitement.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flor.</span> O mother, two men are coming, and they are
bringing father in. I’m afraid he’s killed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> (<i>starting up</i>). What do you mean, child?
(<i>Enter men, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, bearing <span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> clasps her

What is the matter, Henry? Has there been an
accident? (<i>The men place <span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> on sofa and exit <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> It isn’t quite as bad as it seems. I was a
little tired and thought I’d ride up from the village to-night,
instead of walking. But the stage broke down,
and I was thrown out. I was a good deal bruised, but
I believe there are no bones broken. Dr. Bryant examined
me, and said I would be all right in a few
days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Well, as soon as you are able to leave,
I’m going back to the city. I can’t stay here any
longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). You don’t mean that you are
willing to go back to the city, and endure all its discomforts
again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> I’ve come to the conclusion that there are
as many annoyances in the country as in the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> But you forget that the children cannot have
country fare after our return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> No, I do not. I find that the country fare
we sought is all sent to the city, and we must return
there in order to enjoy it. After two weeks’ trial of
living in the country, I am thoroughly tired of it, and
I think a long time will elapse before I again wish to
try the experiment of Boarding on a Farm.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Farwell.</span> Why don’t you get married, Grover?
I suppose you intend, at some time, to take to yourself
a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grover.</span> I might if I could find a woman to
suit me. But I don’t want any of the vain and
frivolous creatures we constantly meet in society.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> They are not all of this description. Now,
there’s Gertrude Hobbs. She is a pretty girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> And when you’ve said that, you’ve said all
there is to say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> I’m sure she is pleasant and agreeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> And weak-minded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> Ah! I see, you would like a girl of spirit.
Then, why not take Kate Ross? The only objection
to her is, that she has an imperious temper. I should
not care to cross her if I were her husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Pooh! that is your
spirit, is it? For my part, there would be no pleasure
in subduing a tame, spiritless creature; but, if somewhat
mettlesome, there would be some excitement in it.
I am half tempted to offer my hand to Kate Ross, to
show you what a simple affair it would be to tame a
spirited woman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> I hope you <i>will</i> do so, as I shall not change
my opinion till it is practically refuted. And I will
wager a hundred dollars that you will talk in quite a
different way after marrying her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> You will probably lose your money. When
I undertake anything, I usually bring it to a successful
termination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I am willing to take the risk.
Theory is very well in its way, but it is practice that
tells the story. I confess I have some curiosity to see
how the matter ends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Well, you will probably have that satisfaction
within six months, as Kate Ross will, without
doubt, be Mrs. Grover before that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> You seem quite confident. Have you proposed
to Miss Ross?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> No; but she would not think of refusing
my offer. An opportunity of gaining such a position
is seldom presented to a poor girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> Very well. If you do not talk in quite a
different way after marrying Kate Ross, the money is
yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> I know that; but you are bound to obey me

There, I think that will set matters right. I would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>

until four, and he should send me away if I took up
dinner before that time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>coolly</i>). Indeed! he is interfering beyond
his province. However, you are to obey me, not him.
Be sure to have dinner on the table at two o’clock
precisely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> But he will send me away if I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> And I will send you away if you don’t.</p>

It’s turned away I’ve got to be whether I do it or
not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Better obey me, Bridget. If he should
turn you away, you shall be back again in less than a
week, and, meanwhile, I will pay you wages; but, if I
turn you away, it will be for good.</p>

dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>coolly continuing her sewing</i>). Certainly.
The table was cleared an hour ago. Bridget kept the
meat at the fire, but I was sure you had dined down
town. Shall I ring for it?</p>

is quite mistaken. I don’t intend to encourage female

the wife to obey. If more husbands had my firmness,
things would go on a little better in the world.
But it isn’t everybody that has my tact at governing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> Not a word.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. H.</span> She has deserted him, and gone, no one

to his room a moment, leaving his pocket-book on the

several hundred dollars—were gone.
And although a thorough search has been instituted, no

out your theory of domestic government under your

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> I certainly do not mean to submit to petticoat

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>smiling blandly</i>). Certainly. Bridget left
me yesterday afternoon, by your direction. I have done
what I could toward supplying her place. I am truly
sorry if the dinner is not to your taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> What do you intend by this insult which
you have put upon me in my own house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>fanning herself</i>). You are a little excited,
Mr. Grover. You remember that I warned you I should
not supply Bridget’s place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). So it seems you want to rule me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Not at all. I only object to being ruled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> It’s the same thing, madam. You would
like to have me become a miserable, hen-pecked husband.
But that will never happen. (<i>Turning to
guests</i>) Gentlemen, I regret that circumstances have
conspired to render useless the invitation I gave you to
dine with me. I cannot, in such case, invite you to stay
longer, but shall renew the invitation at a more convenient
opportunity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>turning toward them</i>). I, too, shall be glad
to see you, gentlemen, and hope, on the next occasion,
to offer you a more attractive collation. That, however,
depends entirely on whether my husband decides to
leave the management of the household where it belongs—in
my hands.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt <span class="smcap">Messrs. Farwell</span> and <span class="smcap">Huntly</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Well, madam, I hope you are
satisfied with this disgraceful exhibition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>quietly</i>). I am not responsible for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> You have disgraced me before my guests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Then why did you interfere with Bridget?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> I am the head of the household.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I beg your pardon. I imagined that Bridget
was under my orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> You are right, as long as your orders do not
conflict with mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Very well, sir, I leave you, then, to the
sole management of the household. (<i>Moves to go out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> Where are you going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Home to my mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>alarmed</i>). Would you desert your husband?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Yes, until he knows his place. (<i>Opens the
door, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> But—what will the world say? Don’t go,
Kate!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>turning</i>). I will stay on one condition, and
on one only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> That you will never, again, interfere in
the affairs of the household, and will agree to my recalling
Bridget, at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. G.</span> (<i>rather sheepishly</i>). Very well, anything for
peace.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>sola</i>). There, sir, I have taught you a lesson.
I understand you proposed to tame me. My
impression is, that it is the husband that has been tamed.
There is truth in the old couplet:—</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Smith.</span> Seems to me, Amanda, that for one who
runs up such a bill as I paid yesterday, you don’t
appear remarkably well dressed. What have you done
with all the gay garments Madame Dubois has lately
made for you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Smith.</span> I haven’t run up any bill, and I don’t
patronize Madame Dubois. She is too high in her
charges for people in our circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> But why should she send her bill here? It
was directed in full, to John Smith, Taylor’s Block,
Central Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I’m sure I don’t know. All I can say is,
there must be some mistake. She never made any garments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
whatever for me. By the way, have you the bill
with you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Yes, here it is. (<i>Takes bill from his pocket,
unfolds it, and shows it to his wife.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> What is the amount?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> One hundred and twenty-five dollars and
forty-seven cents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>surprised</i>). And you paid it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Certainly; I supposed it was all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, I don’t know what can be done
about it. I never had any of the articles mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Do you suppose there is another person of
the same name on this street?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, Bridget told me, last evening, there
were three other John Smiths on this street, two of
whom live in this block.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Then there’ll be no end of mistakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> None as serious as this, I hope.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Bridget</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> It is postmarked Ramsey, Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Have you acquaintances there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> It seems so, though I wasn’t aware of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Do open the letter. I’m really curious to
know whom it is from.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Ah, yes, woman’s curiosity! How do you
know but it may be privacy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I am satisfied that it is not. At all
events, I’m willing to run the risk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Courageous woman! Then I will venture
to open it. (<i>Cuts off edge of envelope and draws out
a small, square piece of paper which he begins to read
aloud.</i>)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You thief, you! You villain, you! So you’ve
basely gone off and taken my best dress and bonnet,
and all the silver my father gave me when I was
married! I suppose you intended to adorn your wife
with the clothes you stole! But you shan’t do it, as
sure as my name is Dorothy Ann. I’ve got track of you,
and just as quick as I can get money enough, I’m coming
right along after you. You’re a mean, shiftless, lazy,
good-for-nothing villain, and if you don’t send all back
within a week, I’ll send the police after you.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>turns towards his wife, smiling</i>). There’s
quite an inducement for John Smith. What do you
think of that for a character? I’d better not have read
the letter aloud. Perhaps you will begin to repent
having married me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I ought to, certainly, if this letter is true.
But you haven’t given me the dress and bonnet yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> No, I never thought of it. I wonder if it
was the wife of this John Smith whose bill I paid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Don’t know. I think it’s doubtful if you
ever find the one to whom it rightfully belongs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I must try, at all events. I don’t feel like
losing so much money, or paying other people’s dressmaker’s
bills.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> What vile odor is that I smell? What have
you for dinner, Amanda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>complacently</i>). What you sent, of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> And that is—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Corned beef and cabbage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I knew it. I thought I could not be
deceived. Such a villanous smell!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>surprised</i>). Of course you knew it. Did
you not send it to me this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>excited</i>). Never! I sent you a pair of the
plumpest wild-fowl to be found in the market. My
mouth fairly watered for a taste of them as I entered
the door, when I was saluted by the scent of that
odious cabbage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> What do you suppose has become of them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Some other John Smith is
doubtless regaling himself on them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Wouldn’t it be a good plan to send Bridget
to see?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Yes, and let her go at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). Some one asks, “What’s
in a name?” If his name happened to be John Smith,
he wouldn’t have to inquire. Why couldn’t my parents
have called me Hezekiah, Ezekiel, or any other heathenish
name rather than plain John? Then I should
not have been victimized in this way.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, followed by a stranger.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> This gentleman wishes to see you, John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stranger</span> (<i>inquiringly</i>). Your name is Smith, sir?
(<i><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> nods.</i>) <i>John</i> Smith, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> That is my name, though I wish to goodness
it wasn’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Str.</span> No wonder, sir, no wonder. When I call on
professional business, people almost always wish they
were somebody else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> And what is your business, if I may be
allowed to inquire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Str.</span> Certainly you may, though there’s no doubt
you’d soon learn it without inquiring. I am Sheriff
Bailey, and I came to levy an execution on your furniture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> And what is that for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Str.</span> Because it is not paid for. Messrs. Phillips
&amp; Hoffman sold you, some time since, a quantity of
furniture amounting to two hundred and fifty dollars,
which was to be paid for in thirty days. Here is the
bill of it. (<i>Passes to <span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span></i>) This was three
months ago, and though they have repeatedly sent
letters calling your attention to it, no notice has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
taken of them. Have you anything to say in regard
to this matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>dryly</i>). I think I have. In the first place,
I haven’t bought any furniture for a year. In the second
place, I never heard of Messrs. Phillips &amp; Hoffman,
and therefore, of course, never bought anything from
them (<i>sighing</i>). The fact is, sir, you’ve got hold of
the wrong John Smith.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Str.</span> You can’t come that dodge on me. The John
Smith that I was looking for lived in Taylor’s Block,
and as this is the place, you must be the man I am
seeking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Do you doubt my word, sir?
Let me inform you that there are two other John Smiths
living in this block, as I know to my sorrow. Besides,
if you’ll take the trouble to look at the furniture, you’ll
see that it has been used a much longer time. I notice
by the bill (<i>glancing at it</i>) that it was a suite of parlor
furniture that was bought, and this is the only furniture
of that description which we possess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Str.</span> (<i>looking around him</i>). This is not a new style
of furniture, certainly. It is possible that I may be
mistaken in the person. If so, I beg your pardon. I
will make inquiries before proceeding further in this
matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>with an injured air</i>). You need make no
apologies, sir. I’m getting used to this sort of thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). Did you bring them back with
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> No, sir, they’ve eaten ’em up. Ann McKay
said Mrs. Smith thought somebody sent ’em as a
present. But she told me privately that they had
dinner an hour earlier than usual.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> A present indeed! They knew very well it
was a mistake, and took occasion to eat their dinner
earlier, in order to have a nice meal before the mistake
could be rectified. Bridget, take the corned beef and
cabbage over, and tell them we have no use for it.
Then come back and open all the windows, and see if
we cannot get rid of this intolerable smell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> But what are we to have for dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Boiled eggs—some of yesterday’s roast—or
anything you may happen to have in the house.

must be so. (<i>Hears sound of a latch-key,—listens.</i>)
That is his step now. (<i>Puts letter back in another pocket

John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I was out on business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> It must have been important business to
keep you out till this hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> To tell the truth it was so. But it isn’t a
matter you would be likely to understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I understand it only too well. (<i>Passes letter
to him.</i>) Who wrote that letter? (<i>Eyes him sharply.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>bursting into a laugh</i>). I understand it all

now, that that’s the case. But I didn’t suppose
you’d be so ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>bridling</i>). Ridiculous indeed! When one’s

for his wife to inquire into the matter.</p>

the next session of the Legislature, I have determined
to apply for a change of name. I believe there are
more rascals by the name of Smith than any other one
name in the world. And if there is any villain who is
brought before the police, he is sure to give his name
as John Smith. I don’t care what the new name is,—Snooks,
Jenkins, or Tubbs,—there isn’t one of them
that would bring a man into trouble half as soon, as to
be called plain John Smith.</p>

through foreign countries, it is really refreshing to reach
one’s native land. (<i>Throws himself into an easy-chair, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>)
But I wonder where Maria and her husband are? They
will be somewhat surprised to see me here a month
earlier than they expected. Fortunately, through all
my travels I have kept my latch-key, and was able to
gain an entrance without the aid of a servant. However,
now that I am here, I feel impatient to see Maria
and Arthur. I think I will ring. (<i>Rings; servant enters,
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Are Mr. and Mrs. Lewis at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant.</span> No, sir, the family are all away at a party.
You are Mrs. Lewis’s brother, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Yes. (<i>Surprised.</i>) Did she expect me to-night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S.</span> Yes, and she bade me say they were sorry to
be obliged to be away. But they wished you to make
yourself comfortable. Here is the evening paper, sir.
(<i>Hands it to him.</i>) As they will not be home till late, I
will conduct you to your room when you wish to retire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> There’s no occasion for that. I remember
my old room very well. I will read a while before I go
to bed. I may possibly sit up till they come home. At
all events, I shall not need any further service from you.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Servant</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p>Well, I must say I’m mystified. In the first place, I
don’t see how Maria heard I should arrive to-day. In
the second place, when I asked if Mr. and Mrs. Lewis
were at home, the servant said <i>all the family</i> were away.
Now people don’t use such an expression as that when
the family consists of only two members. I wonder
whether they have company? I wish I might meet my
sister Eliza here. But I won’t trouble myself with needless
conjectures. I shall learn all about the matter in
the morning. (<i>A pause.</i>) I believe I’ll put on my slippers.
(<i>Opens bag, from which he takes slippers. He takes
off boots, puts on slippers, then takes up evening paper.</i>)
I wonder what the news is. In fact, it will be all news
to me. Ah! here’s the announcement of the arrival of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the Rosamond. But if Maria had seen it she wouldn’t
have supposed that I was a passenger. How <i>could</i> she
have heard of my arrival? That is a mystery to me.
(<i>He commences reading, but in one or two minutes his eyes
close, and he begins to nod. Suddenly his head falls back,
and the paper drops from his grasp. He wakens with a
start.</i>) Why, bless me, I nearly lost myself! I feel
very sleepy. (<i>Looks at his watch.</i>) No wonder—it is
nearly half-past eleven o’clock. I think I will go to
bed. (<i>Picks up paper, and puts it on the table, then takes
his bag—a small one—and a light, and leaves the
room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Curtain falls.</i>)</p>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>—<i>A chamber. There must be a bed in the
room, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span> This may be a lounge, but it must have curtains
around it. These are necessary, and can be arranged
on a light, portable frame. <span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> enters the
room, sets down the lamp on table, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, and looks around,
in astonishment.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> It seems Maria has entirely refurnished this
chamber. I can hardly recognize the room I have occupied
so many times. But I am too sleepy to take much
account of surroundings. If the bed is only comfortable,
I shall not take much notice of anything else. (<i>Takes
off coat, vest, and slippers, which he puts near head of bed,
and extinguishes the light. He then parts the curtains and
throws himself upon the bed, drawing the curtains to after
him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span></p>

<p>(<i>A pause. Then the door opens, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and an ancient
maiden, in party attire, enters. She sets lamp down on
the table. Sits down, herself, and proceeds to divest her
head of its adornings. She takes off two sets of curls,
two or three braids, and numberless hairpins. Also
takes from her mouth a set of false teeth. While these
preparations are going on, she soliloquizes</i>:)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Rachel.</span> What senseless people one meets at a
party, to be sure!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>peeping from between curtains, aside</i>). Who
the deuce is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> (<i>continuing</i>). There was that Fitznoodle,
the puppy, trying to make himself agreeable to our
little Agnes. To be sure, she’s old enough to have a
beau, but I hope to goodness she won’t marry <i>him</i>. I
wouldn’t if he was worth his weight in gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>again peeping out,—in a low tone</i>). What a
fate it would be for a man to marry such a woman as
that! Though, for that matter, there won’t be much
left of her, if she keeps on. She’s got her head most
taken to pieces, already.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Aunt R.</span> puts on a very large night-cap, so that only
a small portion of her face is visible. She suddenly discovers
the other lamp. <span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> frequently peeps out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> (<i>in dismay</i>). Where did that other lamp
come from? I know it wasn’t here when I dressed for
the party. (<i>Looks around. <span class="smcap">Mr. C.’s</span> head disappears,
and the curtains are closed. She discovers a coat and
vest on the chair near head of bed. Her eyes are fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
on them in horror. She wrings her hands.</i>) Oh, there’s
a man in the room, I know there is! I shall faint. (<i>She
suddenly considers that, under the circumstances, this
would be improper.</i>) If I only dared to go and look!
(<i>Stands a moment, with hands tightly clasped together,
grows courageous, and slowly walks toward the bed, peeps
through the curtain, and, darting back, screams.</i>) Oh!
oh! oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>parting the curtains a little</i>). Don’t be
so foolish, madam. I assure you it is all a mistake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> That’s what they always say. (<i>Runs to door,
<span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, looking back now and then, to see if she is pursued;
screams</i>:) Emmeline! James! Help! Murder! Thieves!</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Aunt Rachel</span>.</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> parts the curtain, and looks forth.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Well, I must say, that’s rather curious.
The mystery thickens. Pray who could that female be?
I’m sure it’s no one that I ever saw before. Perhaps
she’s left a handkerchief with her name written on it.
I guess I’ll reconnoitre a little, as she has left me a
light. (<i>Goes to table, lifts, successively, the braids and
masses of curls.</i>) Here is part of her make-up. But
there’s no name on it. In fact, there is nothing to give
any clue to the mystery. But there’s one thing I can
do. I’ll fasten the door so that I shall not be interrupted
again. (<i>Goes to door and locks it.</i>) Now I believe I
will retire once more, and see if I cannot get a little
rest. And for fear I may be routed again, I will leave
the light burning. (<i>He goes to bed.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> (<i>tartly</i>). I tell you there is a man there.
Don’t you believe me? He spoke to me too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> What did he say, Aunt Rachel?</p>

You all look frightened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> And well we may. There’s a man in
Rachel’s room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> That’s all imagination. It is simply impossible
that any one could get in, under the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> (<i>in a high tone</i>). What! Do you mean to
insinuate that I don’t know what I’m talking about?
I guess I haven’t lost the use of any of my faculties yet.
And I saw him with my own eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> Don’t get disturbed, Rachel. We can
easily learn whether there is any one there or not. I
will go myself and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Don’t go, Alfred. If there is a man there,
of course he is armed. What could you do to protect
yourself against the assault of a desperate man, and
one well armed too? Take my advice and call a policeman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> Well, perhaps that would be a better way.
(<i>Starts to go out, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> Well, sir, what do you mean by entering

to <span class="smcap">Aunt R.</span></i>) in such a manner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> I think I can explain it satisfactorily, sir;
but I must first ask a few questions. Is your name
Lewis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> It is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> How long have you occupied this house?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> (<i>puzzled</i>). About a month.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> What was the name of the former occupant?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> His name was Lewis, also. I bought the
house of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> <i>My</i> name is Campbell. I am a brother of
the other Mrs. Lewis. I have been travelling abroad
for the last two years, and arrived here late last evening.
Having a latch-key, and being ignorant of the
change of owners, I entered, but was disappointed at
not finding any one at home. The servant said the
family were away at a party, and offered to conduct
me to my room when I was ready to retire. She said
Mrs. Lewis <i>was expecting her brother</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I was expecting him, but he didn’t come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Under these circumstances, and misled by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
the name, I had no suspicion that I was trespassing.
I therefore told the servant I could easily find the way
to my room, as I had slept there many times before.
I must apologize to this lady (<i>turning to <span class="smcap">Aunt R.</span></i>) for
giving her such a fright, which I assure her was entirely
unintentional on my part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Your explanation is perfectly
satisfactory, sir. Mr. Arthur Lewis lives three blocks
farther down-town. But it is late, and you must be
our guest for the remainder of the night. We will furnish
you with another bed, and——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> (<i>interrupting him indignantly</i>). Do you suppose
I would sleep in that bed after a man had slept
there? Never! Let him stay here the rest of the
night, if he wants to. I shall sleep in the other chamber
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> That’s it, Aunt Rachel. Stand up for your
rights.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Very well, let it be arranged so. And
we’d better all retire, for it is already an hour past
midnight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> I thank you all for your hospitality, and
hope in the morning to be able to vindicate my character
more fully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. L.</span> That is quite unnecessary. Your statement
is entirely satisfactory. (<i>Turns to go out, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Phil.</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">A. R.</span></i>) Hadn’t you better take your

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> No; you didn’t say anything about it, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Well, I supposed you’d know that I should
need something by this time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> It was only an hour ago that you took a bowl of
gruel, and I didn’t think you would wish for anything
more so soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> It was full three hours ago. And I want a
cup of tea,—hot, mind you,—just as soon as I can
have it.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Maria</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>soliloquizing</i>). It is strange that some
people haven’t sense enough to know what a sick person
wants, without being told everything. I always thought
Maria was a good nurse; but she is no better than the
rest of them. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Maria.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Here is a nice cup of tea for you, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>tastes it—throws down the spoon and turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
his head away</i>). It’s hot enough to take the skin off
my mouth. I don’t want any more. Throw it away.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Maria</span> pours it away. She then takes a fan, and
gently fans the invalid. He bears it a moment, then
says</i>:)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Don’t keep that fan going; I shall take
more cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> You said your face was hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Well, I don’t want to be cooled off so suddenly.
Let me taste of that tea again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I threw it away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>in surprise</i>). Threw my tea away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Yes, you told me to. You said you didn’t
want it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> I should think you might know by this time
that I don’t mean what I say. Get me some more,
quick.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Maria</span> goes out. During her absence <span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> remains
quiet, and with his eyes closed. She soon returns.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Why didn’t you stay all day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I hurried all I could, uncle; you know I had to
wait for the tea to get hot. (<i>Tasting.</i>) It’s very nice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>). I’ve got all off the
notion for it, now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Won’t you have some of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> No; I’ve lost all desire for it. (<i><span class="smcap">M.</span> places
tea on the table. A knock is heard.</i>) Who’s that making
such a racket?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I’ll go and see. (<i>Goes out—soon returns.</i>) It’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
Mr. Preston, uncle. He wishes to know how you
are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Tell him it’s none of his business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Yes, uncle. (<i>Goes out—soon returns.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Well, what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> He seemed quite angry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Angry at what, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I suppose at being told it was none of his business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Maria, you didn’t tell him that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Yes, I did, uncle. You told me to tell him it
was none of his business, and he said he shouldn’t
trouble you by calling again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Haven’t you got sense enough to
know that I don’t mean what I say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I supposed, of course, you meant what you
said, though I didn’t exactly like to repeat your message
to him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>after a pause</i>). I guess I’ll try a little of
the tea, Maria. (<i>She brings it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>languidly</i>). You’ll have to feed me, Maria,
I’m so weak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Yes, uncle. (<i>Places napkin under chin, and
proceeds to feed him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> Stop—stop—it’s hot. You’re choking
me. (<i>But <span class="smcap">Maria</span> keeps on.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>moving quickly one side</i>).—Sto-op. Can’t
you understand plain English? I don’t believe there’s a
particle of skin left on my tongue. What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> You told me I ought to know by this time that
you didn’t mean what you said. So I supposed I was
to go on, at any rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> It’s horrible tasting stuff. You’ve been
putting pepper into it. While you were about it, why
didn’t you put in vinegar, too?</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Maria</span>, without a word, goes to the table, takes up the
vinegar-cruet, and pours vinegar into the cup.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>starting up</i>). Maria Davidson, I believe
you are either a fool or insane.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Maria</span> sits down, and begins to cry. <span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> gazes
at her in astonishment. A drumming is heard outside,
<span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>putting his hands to his head</i>). Oh, my
poor head! my poor head! Maria, take my pistol
from the closet, and shoot the rascal. (<i>She goes to the
closet, gets the pistol, and fires, according to his direction.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> What the deuce has got into the girl! (<i>He
starts up, and goes to the window, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>,—mechanically
takes up the pistol which <span class="smcap">Maria</span> had laid down. She
glides out by one door, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, and immediately a policeman
enters by another, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Policeman.</span> So here you are. I’ll just slip on these
bracelets, so you won’t do any more mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>drawing back</i>). What do you mean by insulting
me in such a manner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> You’ve been attempting to murder a man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> No, I haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Didn’t you fire a pistol from the window just
now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. M.</span> No, I didn’t fire it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> Who did fire it, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> (<i>hesitating</i>). Why, I—you see—it was—my
niece that fired it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>looking around room</i>). That’s a likely story.
If she fired the pistol, where is she now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> She went out a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> You can’t come that dodge on me. It was only
a moment ago that it was done, and there’s no one but
you in the room, and I found you with the pistol in
your hand. You must come along with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> But I can’t—I’m sick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> (<i>taking a look at him</i>). You don’t appear to be
dangerously sick. I guess you’re able to go with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> But I had the doctor this morning. I’m
quite feverish, and it might cause my death to go
out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">P.</span> If you’re sick you shall have a doctor to prescribe
for you. Come along. (<i>Takes him by shoulder.</i>)</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria</span> (<i>entering, soliloquizing</i>). My plot has been
carried out well thus far. I don’t think uncle recognized
the policeman. It is astonishing how the habit
of complaining gains on one. But if a person is unreasonable,
and given to complaining, there is nothing
that will effect a cure so soon as <i>taking him at his word</i>.
(<i>Uncle enters, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Ah, have you returned so soon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
uncle? I have felt quite anxious about you, fearing you
might take more cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> You are a very successful little manager,
Maria, upon my word. I felt mortified enough on
starting from my own house in the character of a
criminal. But I could blame no one but myself, since
my orders were all obeyed, not only very promptly,
but <i>very literally</i>. Then I thought what an unreasonable
bear I was, and what a patient little nurse you
were, and by the time we stopped I had become quite
subdued. Then I discovered that the policeman was
my old and valued friend, Mr. Preston. It all flashed
upon my mind that it was a plot to bring me to my
senses, and to show how unreasonable I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Oh, no, uncle, not that exactly. We only aimed
to show you that you imagined yourself worse than you
really were. But hadn’t you better lie down awhile?
You are not accustomed to such exertion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. C.</span> No; I am thoroughly cured in mind and
body. Nothing would tempt me to personate again the
miserable hypochondriac I was when I left the house.
I am cured, and I mean to stay so.</p>

with sober countenance, holds in her hand an open
letter, on which her eyes are fixed. Enter her daughter
<span class="smcap">Clara</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clara.</span> Does your letter contain any sad news, ma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Granby.</span> Not exactly <i>sad</i> news,—but <i>disagreeable</i>,
to say the least.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>interested</i>). What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>glancing at letter</i>). This is a letter from
Aunt Patience Burton. She is coming to make us a
visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> That is <i>horrible</i> news. I shouldn’t want Ernest
to see her—she is so fussy and homely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> He will, no doubt, feel as we do, that
money is of more consequence than a handsome face.
Besides, we shan’t be troubled with her long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> How long do you suppose she will stop here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> A week or two, I suppose. That is the
usual length of her visits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>with the air of a martyr</i>). Well, I suppose we
must try to endure her presence for that length of time—hoping
for our final reward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>in a brighter tone</i>). If she could only be
persuaded into making her will in our favor, I shouldn’t
consider the trouble of having her here anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> How much is she supposed to be worth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> About thirty thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Just think how much more that amount would
benefit us than it does her. I dare say she hoards it
up like a miser.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). That will be all the better for
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Yes, if we get it. But when does the letter say
she is coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I did not notice particularly. Let me
see. (<i>Looks over letter—reads</i>:) “You may expect
me Friday, the twenty-fifth, wind and weather permitting.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). The twenty-fifth! Why, that’s
to-day! (<i>Bell rings outside.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> And there is the bell. I shouldn’t be at
all surprised if that were she. (<i>Both rise.</i>)</p>

<p>(<i>Enter, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, a prim, elderly lady, with corkscrew curls,
and wearing an old-fashioned bonnet.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>greeting her with a smile of welcome, and
shaking hands warmly</i>). Why, Aunt Patience, how
glad I am to see you! Clara and I were just speaking
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Prudence</span> (<i>diving into the recesses of an
ample pocket</i>). Wait a minute, Elviry. (<i>Takes out an
ear-trumpet, which she adjusts to her ear.</i>) There, now
we can talk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>in a loud tone</i>). I had no idea you were
so deaf, aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> I’m getting old, you know, and can’t expect
to keep my faculties like younger people. But where’s
Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> This is Clara. (<i>Steps aside for her daughter
to approach.</i>) Didn’t you recognize her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> No, she’s grown so I didn’t know her. How
d’ye do, dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>shaking hands</i>). How do you do, aunt? I’m
glad to see you here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Thank ye, child. It’s pleasant to find that
old folks aint always forgotten and wished out of the
way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>in a loud voice</i>). Let me assist you in taking
off your bonnet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> You needn’t speak so loud when I have my
trumpet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Then you can hear without using it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Yes, but not without you speak pretty loud.
(<i>Lays her trumpet down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>taking aunt’s bonnet, and carrying it to
table. Addressing daughter.</i>) You see, she’s as deaf
as can be. (<i>Old lady sits down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> That’s lucky. We can relieve our minds without
her hearing us. Is she going to stay long?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I don’t know. I will ask her. (<i>In a loud
voice:</i>) I hope you are going to make us a long visit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> I shan’t be able to stop more than a month.
But perhaps it won’t be convenient for you to have me
with you so long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>in a loud tone to aunt</i>). We shall be delighted
(<i>in a lower tone to her daughter</i>) when you go
away. That’s true, isn’t it, Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Yes, indeed. But (<i>dismally</i>) do you suppose
we can live through the month?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> We must try to, for the sake of the
money. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Aunt P.</span></i>) Have you been well, lately,
aunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> No, I’ve enjoyed dreadful poor health this
winter. I’ve been most dead with roomatiz and I
haven’t got over it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> It must have been hard to bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Yes, it made me feel as if I ought to make
my will, and I think I shall make it as soon as I get
home again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Oh, you have many years yet to live,
aunt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> I can see well enough that I am getting old,
and cannot live long, anyway. I get tired out very
easy. I think I shall have to ask you to show me to
the room I am to occupy, and I will lie down awhile.
I aint much used to travelling, and it tires me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Shan’t I get you a cup of tea, aunt?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Oh, no. All I need is a little rest.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> There, I think we have made a good impression.
If she only makes a will in our favor, I
shall consider the attentions we pay her a good investment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> But suppose she shouldn’t leave her money to
us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Oh, don’t let your imagination run in that
direction. We must manage to get into her good graces,
so that we may become her heirs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Well, I will do all I can to bring about so desirable
a result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ernest Montgomery.</span> Good-evening. You were
expecting me, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Of course I was. I always remember appointments.
But I suppose I must introduce you to my
aunt. (<i>In a loud tone</i>:) Aunt Patience, this is Mr.
Montgomery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> (<i>extending her hand to the young man</i>). I am
very glad to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">E. M.</span></i>). We shan’t need to take any further
notice of her. She’s deaf as an adder, and can’t hear
a word without her trumpet unless we scream at her.
I believe you never saw her before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> She isn’t very handsome, is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> Aren’t you afraid she’ll hear you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Oh no, she’s too deaf.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> But deaf people generally hear things that
are not intended for their ears.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Well, I’ll run the risk. When we speak to her
she seldom hears the first time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> What was that you said?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>in a loud tone</i>). Only that it was so long since
you had been here that we should try to make you have
a pleasant time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> (<i>in a satisfied tone</i>). Oh, was that it? Thank
you, child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> (<i>with admiration</i>). You got out of that well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Trust me for that. When one has a rich aunt,
it is the best to keep on the right side of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Did you speak to me, Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> No; I was telling Mr. Montgomery how fond I
was of cider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> I used to like cider when I was a girl; but that
was the genuine article, and we used to go to the mill
where they made it, and take it through a straw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> (<i>interested</i>). So your aunt is rich?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Yes; she is said to be worth thirty thousand
dollars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> That’s quite a fortune.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> (<i>as if talking to herself</i>). Yes; deafness is
quite a misfortune; but one doesn’t mind it so much
when they’re stopping among their own relations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes, it is quite a fortune, and of course
we put up with her oddities for the sake of the money,
which will, most of it, come to us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> She may outlive you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> That’s what I’m afraid of. It would be just our
luck to have her live to be a hundred.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> How old is she now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> About sixty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> Then you would only have to wait thirty-five
years for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> We might as well never have her money as to
wait so long as that for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> It would be rather a long while, that’s a fact.
By that time you would look as your aunt does now.
Do you know, I think you resemble her very much?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>tapping him playfully with her fan</i>). Take that
for your impertinence, sir. I must be a charming damsel,
if that were the case.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> So I thought; which was why I made the
remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>flushing</i>). I don’t esteem it any compliment.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> What was that you said, Clara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> I was saying to Mr. Montgomery that people
seldom say what they mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> (<i>nodding</i>). That’s true—that’s true enough.
(<i>After a pause—holding up knitting.</i>) Well, there, I’ve
got that stocking pretty well along, and haven’t been
knitting a great while, either. Mr. Montgomery, may
I trouble you to tell me what time it is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> It is no trouble, madam, I assure you. (<i>Looks
at watch.</i>) It is about (<i>hesitates</i>) five minutes past
ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. P.</span> Five minutes past ten! I had no idea ’twas
so late. (<i>Gathers up her knitting.</i>) That’s long past
the time I usually go to bed. Good-night, Mr. Montgomery;
good-night, Clara.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Good-night, aunt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> Good-evening, madam.</p>

more than nine o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E. M.</span> (<i>looking at watch</i>). It is just half-past eight.
But although I enjoyed her society exceedingly, I was
willing to deny myself that pleasure for the sake of having
a little private conversation with you on a very important
matter. (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span> casts down her eyes. <span class="smcap">Mr.

</div><p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Doesn’t it seem a great relief to have Aunt Patience
gone?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I must say that it does. I was constantly
anxious for fear she would learn our real feelings,
though I flatter myself we concealed them quite
carefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> I don’t believe she suspected at all that we were
glad her visit was over. Deaf people are most always
obtuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I hope it may prove so, for her money
would be a great help to us. In fact, I don’t see how
we can get along without it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> It would be very convenient if she would let us
have an instalment of a few thousands soon—before
my marriage, for instance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> Yes, in that case we could afford to send
to Paris for your trousseau. But has the time for the
wedding been fixed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Yes; Ernest wishes it to take place in June.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> I spoke of your marriage as liable to take
place soon, and hoped Aunt Patience would take the
hint; but she didn’t seem to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> What reply did she make?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> She said she hadn’t anything special against
Mr. Montgomery, but that <i>she</i> would never think of
choosing <i>him</i> for a husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Perhaps he reciprocates her feelings. I don’t

It is worse than that.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Niece Elvira</span>: Thinking you might be anxious to
hear from me, I write to say that I reached home safely.
But since my arrival I have had an attack of rheumatic
fever. Therefore, feeling that life is uncertain, yesterday
I made my will. Before visiting you I had decided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
to leave my property to you; but I changed my mind,
and have concluded to leave it to the Home for Aged
Women, a charitable institution, where it will, I hope,
do a great deal of good.</p>

<p>“I shall not visit you again. It would be too much
of a tax on you to ask you to put up with my odd ways.
As you remarked to Clara when I came that you would
be delighted to have me go, this information will doubtless
be pleasing to you. Besides, I have a presentiment
that I shall not live long, notwithstanding Clara’s
fears to the contrary.</p>

<p>“Although deaf as an adder when I came to visit
you, my hearing has been wonderfully restored, so that
I can now dispense with my ear-trumpet. I therefore
send it to you, hoping it may do you as good service as
it did me, in showing me for what I was valued most.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> and <span class="smcap">Clara</span> look blankly at each other.</i>)</p>

Aunt Patience’s money after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). It’s a real mean thing for any one
to be so deceitful—going round pretending to be deaf.
I’m glad she isn’t coming here again. I couldn’t
endure the sight of her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serv.</span> (<i>entering, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>). Here’s a note that Mr.

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> But why didn’t he stop?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S.</span> He heard you reading the letter, and he said
he couldn’t stop but a moment; a message would do
just as well as seeing you. So he wrote this note in the
drawing-room, and asked me to give it to you. (<i><span class="smcap">Clara</span>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Miss Clara Granby</span>: I have received an appointment
which will carry me to India, and I am to sail for
that place this afternoon. I called to bid you good-by,
but finding you engaged, and being myself in great
haste, I make my adieu on paper. As I may be gone
for a long time, perhaps a number of years, I deem it
my duty to release you from your engagement.</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Ernest Montgomery.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> What does it mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). It means that he overheard
enough of Aunt Patience’s letter to know that we are
not to have any of her property; so he has magnanimously
released me from my engagement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> But what are you going to do about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> Do? I don’t know as there is anything to be
done. In fact, my present feelings of indifference towards
him show that my affections were not involved,
and I am well satisfied to have him leave me as he has
done. As to Aunt Patience, I guess we can get along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
without any of her money. I have several accomplishments
that can be turned to account if necessity requires
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. G.</span> (<i>with motherly solicitude, and looking at the
matter from a practical point of view</i>). But young
ladies who earn their own living are considered strong-minded,
and never get married. I couldn’t bear to have
you an old maid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C.</span> (<i>calmly</i>). Well, I don’t know as that would be
a terrible fate. It would be a more independent life
than marriage would give me. On the whole, I think I
shall decide to live a single life. (<i>Smiling.</i>) Still, as
an old lady of eighty once said: “I’ve made up my
mind not to get married, and I don’t expect to; but if
the Lord should see fit to send me a good husband, I
should try to be resigned.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Flora.</span> Oh, yes, mother believes in ghosts, and
haunted houses, and all those things, and I suppose
that, as a dutiful daughter, I ought to do the same; but
I haven’t very much faith in them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Percival.</span> Perhaps, if you had had any experience
in that direction, you might feel differently about
the matter. I never believed in haunted houses till I
visited Charlie Baldwin, my former chum, last summer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Do tell us all about it. I should like to hear a
real nice ghost story.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lawrence.</span> I think we’d better wait till daylight
before listening to a story of that character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> No, it’s just the time for it; it is cold and dark
outside. We can more easily imagine the events real.
So go on, please, Mr. Percival.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span>—But my story is not a ghost story at all,
and there is really very little to tell. But we heard
strange noises for which we could not account. For
instance, a door, which led from the house into the
shed, had swollen so that it was difficult to shut it, and
whenever it was opened and shut it creaked most musically,
so that it could be heard in all the lower rooms.
One evening we were seated at the tea-table, when we
heard the door creaking. “Who is that coming in?”
asked Mrs. Baldwin. “It is very strange,” answered
Charlie; “I am sure I closed and locked that door not
ten minutes ago.”—“Suppose we go out and see what
it is,” said Mr. Baldwin. “It certainly had a natural
sound.” We all went out in a body, and behold! the
door was shut and fastened and everything all right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>interested</i>). Did you hear any other noises
while you were there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Oh, yes, we frequently heard footsteps going
up and down stairs after we had gone to bed. Sometimes
we could hear the chairs moved about in the
rooms below. And once, I remember, we heard a
terrific noise, as if the side of the house had fallen in.
But the next morning everything seemed as usual, and
we laughed about the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> But were you not startled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Well, I cannot say I should like to live in
that house long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> If you had heard all these things, Flora,
don’t you think you would have faith to believe that
there are some strange things which one cannot account
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Oh, yes; “seeing is believing,” as the old saying
is, and I suppose <i>hearing</i> is believing also. But I
must ask you to excuse me now, Mr. Percival, as I
have a letter to write, which must go out by the next
mail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Though we are sorry to lose your company,
we will grant you leave of absence for a short time.
(<i>Rises and opens the door for her, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> Exit <span class="smcap">Flora</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>sitting down near <span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span></i>). The turn
which the conversation took just now suggested a plan
to me, which, with your permission, I should like to
carry out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> You are, of course, aware that I love your
daughter, and would gladly marry her. She has
rejected me, but still I think she likes me as well or
better than any one else. Now, cannot I, by stratagem,
bring her to consent to a marriage with me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I wish you might do so, and will gladly
assist you in any way I can. But what is your plan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> I thought I might, with your assistance,
personate the spirit of her former husband, and appear
to her to-night while this conversation is fresh in her
mind, and warn her, if she wishes him to rest in peace,
that she must marry a certain Alfred Percival, who will
make her a good husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> It is a capital idea. I think the conversation
seemed to affect her considerably. Suppose you
come here at ten o’clock to-night. I will remain up,
and arrange your ghostship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Very well, I will do so. And I believe I
will go now, as I have some preparations to make.</p>

what it can be isn’t quite clear to me. Mother has
asked me half-a-dozen times if it wasn’t bed-time; and
yet she, herself, hasn’t made any preparation toward
retiring. I shall lie down, with my clothes on, ready
for any emergency. There’s no danger of sleep overtaking
me. I feel as if I shouldn’t sleep any at all
to-night.</p>

<p>(<i>She lies down on lounge, in right-hand room, and

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> (<i>outside</i>). I am glad you are so punctual.
Everything is in readiness. I just looked into Flora’s
room and found she was fast asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>in rather a high key</i>). Where shall I go to
arrange my costume?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> (<i>deprecatingly</i>). Hush! you mustn’t speak so
loud, as her door is ajar. Come with me, and we’ll
soon have you fitted out.</p>

<p>(<i>They enter left-hand room cautiously. A sheet lies
unfolded on a chair. This <span class="smcap">Mrs. L</span>. drapes around her
companion. He gathers it together so as to conceal his
clothes.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> It will never do to allow your features to
show so plainly. You are only Alfred Percival, after
all. Flora would recognize you at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Suppose I put the sheet over my head? (<i>Does
so.</i>) Is that any improvement?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Yes; but still I think your features would
betray you. Let me think a moment. I have it. I
will get Mr. Willis’s wig; that will be just the thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> So it will. That’s a good idea. (<i>She takes
wig out of box. <span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> puts it on.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> That’s capital. Now stoop a little, and no

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>in apparent horror</i>). Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>in sepulchral voice</i>). Flora Willis, I am the
spirit of your dead husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> But why do you appear to me in this way? If
you are really he, why should you come to me at the
dead of night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>in hollow tones</i>). We, who are tenants of
another sphere, mingle not with mortals; and it is only
when all eyes are closed in slumber that we are permitted
to walk the earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>gaining confidence</i>). But what is your object in
coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>slowly</i>). I come to warn and advise you.
You are young, and, I know, cherish my memory fondly;
but I feel sure that you would be happier and enjoy
life more, if you should marry again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> But who is there I should be happy with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> You have many suitors; choose among
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I’m afraid they want my money more than myself,
and such a union would cause a lifetime of misery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> You are mistaken. There is Alfred
Percival. He would be a kind husband. It is my wish
that you marry him. Promise me that you will do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I cannot promise; it is too sudden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Think of it, then. One week from to-night
I will visit you again. (<i>Passes slowly out into left-hand
room.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>musing</i>). Well, that’s curious. I’ve heard
ghost stories of almost every description, but never before
did I hear of a ghost making love. For, though
he intended to personate a spirit, he certainly spoke of
himself. And I suppose he is congratulating himself
on having completely deceived me. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) I’d
like to know what he and mother are saying about it.
And why can’t I? They are only in the next room.</p>

<p>(<i>She rises and creeps cautiously to the door, which

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Then you think she did not suspect you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Apparently not. She appeared quite
startled at first, but soon regained her composure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I suppose it would be better not to allude
to the subject to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Not on any account. That would tend to
arouse her suspicions. I wouldn’t have her know that
I took part in the stratagem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> And what do you expect will come of it?
Of course she would not be likely to come forward and
tell you that she was willing to marry you, even if she
felt favorably inclined toward you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). I think I shall call upon her

mind to accept him. Then the matter will be settled,

Besides, he is a person of good standing, and I don’t

of their wings.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Excuse me, but I never heard it expressed
in that way before. It has been told me in this wise:
His Satanic Majesty is always near when you’re talking
of him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I must say my version is more complimentary
than yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> So do I, and I draw encouragement from
that fact. If you were thinking of me, I take it as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
favorable omen, and shall consider that I am not so
disagreeable to you as I feared I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>interrupting</i>). Oh, by the way, Mr. Percival, I
had quite an adventure last night. I saw a real, <i>bona
fide</i> ghost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> Did you really?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Yes; as I was quietly dozing, a tall figure, clad
in white, stalked into my room, and when I opened my
eyes I beheld him close beside me, and looking down
upon my face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>avoiding her eyes</i>). And what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (laughing). Oh, he pretended to be the spirit of
my former husband, and said I must marry again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>taking both her hands in his</i>). Why will
you not heed his advice? Let me, too, add my solicitations.
Marry me, Flora, and you shall never have
cause to regret it. (<i>He anxiously waits her reply.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>looking up into his face with an amused smile</i>).
Why, Mr. Percival, how much you remind me of my
last night’s visitor! The expression of your face, and
the lines about your mouth—all but the white sheet
and wig.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>changing color</i>). I see that you know all;
but grant me a favorable answer, and I shall be well
satisfied.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I suppose I ought to, since it is
decided on high authority that it is right and proper I
should do so. In that way, if in no other, I shall convince<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
you that I am not afraid of ghosts, if I promise
to marry one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. P.</span> (<i>warmly</i>). And I shall feel well repaid for personating
one by the promised reward. Henceforth I shall
look with kindness on shadowy apparitions, feeling that,
in other cases as well as my own, even ghosts may be
of some practical use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>—<i><span class="smcap">Frank</span> is seated, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, in the depths of an
arm-chair, his feet resting on the table. He is smoking
a cigar. Enter <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwin.</span> Well, Frank, you look decidedly cosey and
comfortable, that’s a fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> (<i>not altering his position, but motioning his
visitor to a seat</i>). That’s the way to do. One might
as well enjoy life as he goes along. Have a cigar,
Aldrich? (<i>Offers him an open case, in which are
cigars.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>throwing himself on a lounge, <span class="allsmcap">L. C.</span></i>). No, Frank,
I believe not. The fact is, I’ve reformed—given up
smoking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Whew! I’ll wager that’s one of the consequences
of matrimony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I don’t deny it. But I think smoking is a bad
habit, and have thought of giving it up before, but
never could persevere till now. That reminds me,
Frank; why don’t you marry? I dare say you could
find some one in the city foolish enough to take you for
better or worse. And you don’t know what a comfort
’tis to a man to have a good wife and a pleasant
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> That’s where the trouble is (<i>fondly stroking his
mustache</i>). As you say, I could easily persuade some
one to marry me, knowing as they do that I possess
plenty of money. But don’t you think it would make
a difference if I were a poor man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I dare say it might with some persons; but all
are not alike. I am sure there are many who esteem
wealth of less importance than personal worth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>assuming a sitting posture, and laying cigar down</i>).
I have often thought I should like to marry; but
when I looked around among the ladies with whom I
was brought in contact, I became disgusted to see what
frivolous lives they led.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> But all women are not alike, Frank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> That may be so, but where shall I go to look for
a different class? I have strong domestic tastes, and
would be glad to change my present state of single
blessedness for a married life. If I could find my ideal
of a wife, I would marry at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I’ll tell you what it is, Frank. You must go
into the country. The girls are mostly sensible there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
and think less about dress and fashion. You can assume
another name, and then look around you, and
become acquainted with some of the country girls.
My wife was born and brought up in the country, so I
can speak from experience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> But how could I manage? I couldn’t go to a
hotel and stop with nothing to do. Country girls are
ambitious as well as those who live in the city, and if I
remained there with no occupation, I should be supposed
to be a man of some property, and I shouldn’t be
much better off than I am here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> That’s so, my friend. I never gave you credit
for so much shrewdness. But isn’t there anything you
could do,—any kind of business, I mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I have it. I’ll hire myself out on a farm. In
that way, as one of the family, I shall become more intimately
acquainted with the neighborhood—girls
included.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Imagine fastidious Benjamin Franklin Webster
dressed in coarse clothes and cowhide boots! (<i>Looking
upward.</i>) Shades of the illustrious men whose
names he bears, look down with benignity on the depth
of degradation to which he proposes to descend!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). That’ll do, Ed. I am only following
the example of at least one of those illustrious men in
working on a farm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> And those delicate hands, that never did any
manual labor, are to be used in milking the cows and
holding the plough!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Laugh away, Ed. I’ve made my plans, and
now I’m going to carry them out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> But, seriously, will your strength hold out?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Without doubt. Besides, every one says farming
is the most healthful occupation any one can follow.
So you may expect to see me back in the fall so stout
and fleshy that my friends will hardly know me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> And perhaps you will bring Mrs. Benjamin
Franklin Webster with you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> That’s very uncertain. I haven’t really very
great faith in the project myself; but I’m tired of my
present way of living, and any change will be welcome,
even if it does not bring about the desired result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> But how are you going to obtain the situation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> How am I? (<i>Smiling.</i>) That’s the question
before the meeting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Suppose you advertise for one. That would be
the best way, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> The very thing. Couldn’t you write an advertisement
for me, Ed? You know I’m modest, and
couldn’t, of course, speak of my qualifications as well
as you could.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Edwin</span> takes sheet of paper from the table, and writes
for a few moments; then reads it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>reading</i>). “<span class="smcap">Wanted</span>—By a young man, a situation
on a farm. Is willing to work for moderate
wages, provided he can learn the business. Address
Franklin Forrester, Box 68.” How will that do,
Frank?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I guess that’ll answer. But what paper would
it be best to insert it in? The evening “Herald”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Oh no, that wouldn’t do. It must be an agricultural
paper. Better put it into several; then you
will be more sure of a reply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I’ll insert it in every agricultural paper in the
city. If I get one reply from each, I shall have at
least six.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Very well. If one has an object in view, there’s
nothing like taking every method to accomplish it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene II.</span>—<i><span class="smcap">Frank</span> seated <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, before a table covered with
letters. Enter <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

</div><p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Well, I must say the agricultural papers in the
city have a goodly number of subscribers, judging from
appearances. This is the first edition of letters, I suppose.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Yes, and, judging from the slight examination I
have made, it already needs to be revised and corrected.
But there’s no doubt about my getting a situation,
Ed. You see what a demand there is for my services.
Sixty letters already! I can almost imagine myself at
the head of a village post-office.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> The quality may not be as satisfactory as the
quantity. But if all these letters are to be examined,
we must to work, and use diligence too. Suppose you
open them, and read them aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> That’s a good way. Here’s one written in a

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Ha! ha! ha! That’s a good one.
If you go there you’ll be sure to learn one branch of
the business pretty thoroughly. Shall you accept, and
become a member of Mr. Porcupine’s family? By the
way, he has a charming name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Yes, characteristic, I dare say. Accept the first
chance? No indeed; not as long as I have fifty-nine
more left. (<i>Opens another letter.</i>) But what is this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I’m all attention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>reading</i>). Mr. Forrester: “I notice by my
paper that you want to learn to farm. I should like to
teach you ‘what I know about farming.’ It would
take some time to do it, but I would warrant you a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
knowledge of farming in six years. You couldn’t fail
to get a thorough knowledge of the business, as I should
let you do all the work. My health is poor, and I am
only able to oversee the work. As you want a situation,
you may as well consider yourself engaged. I
shall expect you next Monday. <span class="smcap">Horace Gregory.</span>”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Well! that’s cool! I am afraid that man is
troubled by a disease called indolence. But, Ed, we
are getting along too slowly. Suppose you and I read
letters as fast as we can, and if either of us finds one
that we consider suitable it shall be read aloud. If not,
it shall be thrown into the waste basket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Agreed.</p>

laughing aloud as they read something which excites their
mirth. At length <span class="smcap">Edwin</span> says:</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Here, Frank, here’s just the place for you.
Shall I read?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Do so by all means. I am nearly discouraged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>reading</i>). “Franklin Forrester, Esq.—Dear Sir:
Uncle William wishes me to write to you concerning an
advertisement of yours which he read in our paper. He
judges from it that you are not accustomed to working
on a farm. He has already two men, but wishes a little
more help, provided arrangements satisfactory to both
parties could be made. He is willing to pay whatever
is reasonable as regard wages, but not knowing how
much you can do, he can say nothing more definite. If
you wish any further information, a letter directed to
William Leighton, Ballardvale, Vermont, will receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
prompt attention. But if you prefer to come without
writing, uncle will be glad to see you at any time after
the receipt of this letter.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). What is the signature?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> There is none, but it is evidently a lady’s hand.
What do you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I think I shall start for Ballardvale to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> That’s a wise conclusion. You will be back by

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Leighton.</span> Well, Mr. Forrester, how do you
like your first day’s experience on a farm?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Very much, indeed. But, you know, I have not
had any work to do yet. Mr. Leighton, unlike most
employers, has given me a vacation to start with.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> He wishes you to have a little time in which
to look around first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annie</span> (<i>smiling</i>). You find the hour for rising a
little earlier here than in the city, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Yes, I do. This morning I was awakened by the
sound of a bell. I listened, wondering what could be
the matter. There were sounds from below, as if something
had happened. Doors were opened and shut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
hurriedly, and I could hear the voices of men outside.
I dressed as quickly as I could, and hurried downstairs.
But it appeared that nothing unusual had taken
place. Mrs. Leighton was getting breakfast, and you
were laying the table. I glanced up at the clock, and
saw that it was a quarter past four o’clock (<i>smiling</i>),—about
four hours earlier than I have been accustomed to
rise. Then it occurred to me that people living on farms
are obliged to get up early.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> Yes, my mother used to say that an hour
in the morning was worth three later in the day. But
did you rest well, Mr. Forrester?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Oh yes, very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> When I pass the night in the city I can’t
sleep, there is so much noise. But last summer a lady
who was visiting here could not sleep because <i>she missed
the noise</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> There is a great deal in habit. (<i>A pause.</i>) By
the way, I said that I had done no work to-day. I forgot
to mention that I had accomplished a feat which I
never attempted before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> What was that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I unharnessed the horse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> How did you succeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> I got the harness off, but not very scientifically,
I’m afraid, for I heard Mike tell Jerry that that city
chap was the curiousest feller he ever see, for he unfastened
every buckle that was in the harness, and then
left it in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I think that’s a little worse than I
should do, for I believe I should endeavor to hang the
harness up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> To tell the truth, I thought of doing so, but there
were so many small pieces that it was impossible. If
I had found a basket near, I should have gathered them
up and put them in that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> That would be a novel method of disposing
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. L.</span> I expect, Mr. Forrester, that you are one
of those students who don’t know much about anything
but books.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> At all events I find, in looking around me, that
I don’t know much about farming. But there’s one
good feature in the case: I am anxious to learn.</p>

me, but he was the very person who suggested the idea
of my coming here. I believe he planned the whole
affair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> I think you are mistaken there; for Uncle
William had no thought of hiring another person till he
saw your advertisement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Well, of course Ed knew about it when he saw Mr.
Leighton’s letter in reply to the advertisement. But, as I
was saying, I had the misfortune to lose my parents when
quite young, and thereby became heir to a large amount
of property. As I grew up to manhood, my society
was sought after by all the marriageable young ladies
and managing mammas. I determined to find someone
who would love me for myself alone; so I came out
here, and found my wishes realized. Can you forgive
me, Annie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> What! for coming out here, and wishing to
marry me? Yes, I’ll try to. But (<i>archly</i>) I, too, have
a confession to make. I also am possessed of property,
and came out here to Uncle William for the self-same
reason that you did. But I didn’t change my name. I

arrive?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Look here, you villain! You planned this affair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>striking an attitude and speaking in a melancholy
tone</i>). He calls me a villain for being the means of
making him happy. Annie, if I were you, I’d release
him from the engagement at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Come, Edwin, you haven’t told me
when you arrived.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I have been here two hours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> (<i>in a comico-threatening manner</i>). Tell me, sir,
did you not plan this whole affair?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>more seriously</i>). No, I knew nothing of it till I
read the letter in reply to the advertisement. I then
recognized the handwriting, and in that way discovered
that Annie was stopping here. I felt sure that you
would be pleased with one another, and would both pass
a pleasant summer, if nothing more came of it. Yesterday
was the first day of my vacation, and I thought
it time to be looking after you. But aunt tells me you
are engaged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F.</span> Yes, and I feel amply repaid for coming so far,
and for working three months on a farm, in order to
secure a wife to my mind. If any of my friends in the
city are troubled in the same way that I was, I shall recommend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
to them to try my remedy, trusting it may
produce the same gratifying results.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> And in that way I suppose they may expect to
get a good knowledge of “<i>Practical Husbandry</i>.”</p>

Her husband, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, is looking over the evening paper. He
lays it down.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Smith.</span> Well, Mrs. Smith, what is the news?
You look as sober as if you had lost all your friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Smith.</span> It is a serious matter. This letter informs
me that my sister Sarah is sick, and it is doubtful
if she recovers. I ought to go and see her, but I
am afraid I shall not be able to do so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Why, what is the difficulty? I see nothing
to prevent your going. I’m sure you haven’t much to
do. There are only three of us in the family, and
Bridget does all the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Yes, Bridget will do very well, if there’s
some one to look after her. But she isn’t one to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
depended upon. I shouldn’t dare to leave Willie with
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I think she would get along well enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I shouldn’t be willing to go under any such
circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Would you be any better satisfied if I
should stay at home and look after things?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Oh, yes, certainly. But could you leave
the office for a whole day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I think so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> Well, then, I will go on the first train to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> You needn’t hurry back. We shall get
along famously, I am sure; so you’d better stay till
the late train, if you have the least desire to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> I should like to do so. That would give
me a nice long day there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>rising</i>). If you take the first train we must
be up betimes. What time do the cars leave here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> At eight o’clock, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I will go now and write a note to Mr. Ferguson,
saying I shall not be at the office to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> (<i>sola</i>). This is a good chance for me. I
want very much to see Sarah. And then Mr. Smith is
constantly telling me that I can’t have much to do. It
will be a good thing for him to have a little experience
in house-keeping. I think one day’s trial will be sufficient
to satisfy him.</p>

how can I do it wid him spyin’ round?</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mr. Smith</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, Bridget, we are left to keep house all
alone to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>sullenly</i>). Yis, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> What did Mrs. Smith say we were to have
for dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Cold roast beef and rice puddin’; an’ I was to
make some hot biskit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> It won’t take very long to do that, will it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>hoping for leave of absence after dinner</i>). No,
sir, I could do that much in an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, Bridget, Mrs. Smith is to be away all
day, and I thought we’d clean the kitchen closet while
she’s gone, and so surprise her when she comes home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> An’ d’ye think I’ll begin a big job like that while
she’s away? She always helps me at cleanin’-house
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Oh, well, I’ll help you. I’ll take down the
dishes, and you can wash and wipe them, and wash out
the closet. Then I’ll help you put them back again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Axin’ yer pardon, sir, I can’t do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> What! do you refuse to obey orders? (<i>Sarcastically.</i>)
I suppose you’ll expect to receive your
wages just the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Av coorse I shall. I never refuses to do anything
the <i>missis</i> requires, but I aint goin’ to be ordered
round <i>by a man</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> If you’re not willing to do what I tell you,
the sooner you find another place, the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>angrily</i>). I’m goin’ to lave the house this blessed
minnit, so I am. It’s Bridget McFinnigan that won’t
be imposed upon by the likes uv you, or any other man!
(<i>She takes off her apron hastily, throws it over a chair,
and leaves the room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, full of indignation.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, I’m afraid I’ve got myself into trouble.
I’d better have waited till after dinner before speaking
about cleaning. But, as it seems I’ve got to do what I
can, alone, I might as well finish washing the breakfast
dishes. (<i>Takes <span class="smcap">Bridget’s</span> apron, and ties it on loosely.
He begins to wipe a plate, but it falls from his hands and
is broken.</i>) There goes a plate. I must go and throw
it into the stove, or Mrs. Smith will be twitting me about
breaking things. (<i>Goes to the next room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, where a stove
is supposed to be, and leaves the broken plate. Returns
and commences washing dishes again.</i>) After all, there
isn’t much work about keeping house. It’s astonishing
how these women can employ all their time! Perhaps
it is better that Bridget left me as she did to-day, as
now I can show Mrs. Smith how easily housework may
be disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willie</span> (<i>enters, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, with torn clothes, and rubbing
his eyes with his hands</i>). Ur-r-r-r, ur-r-r-r, (<i>louder</i>)
ur-r-r-r!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> What’s the matter? What’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>crying</i>). Sammy Snow set his dog on to me,
and hurt me. Ur-r-r-r!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, be a brave boy, and don’t cry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>crying</i>). Give me some raisins, and I won’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I don’t know where mamma keeps them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I do; it’s in the kitchen closet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Does mamma give them to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Sometimes, and sometimes I get them myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, you can get a <i>very few</i>. Raisins are
not good for little boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>aside</i>). I guess I’ll have enough raisins this
time. (<i>Goes out, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I ought to finish washing the dishes, but
perhaps I’d better see about dinner, first. Let me see.
We were to have rice pudding. I haven’t time to make
an elaborate pudding. I think I’ll just boil some rice.
That is always good.</p>

<p>(<i>He goes toward the table, but steps on his apron and
falls. He reaches forward to take hold of the table, but,
instead, grasps the paper of rice, and both go on to the
floor, the rice scattering in all directions. He gets up,
rubbing his bruised arm, and looks ruefully at the scene
before him; just then <span class="smcap">Willie</span> comes in crying.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> There aint any raisins there, ur-r-r! Papa,
what was I crying for, ur-r-r!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>coaxing him</i>). Don’t cry, Willie, but come
and help papa pick up this rice, and you shall have an
orange when I go to the store.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> I want it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I haven’t got one now; but here’s an apple,
and I’ll give you an orange this afternoon. (<i><span class="smcap">Willie</span>
takes the apple. They gather up some of the rice,
leaving the greater part of it on the floor.</i>) I wonder how
much of this I ought to boil. There are only two of
us. I think a quart will be enough. (<i>Measures it.</i>) I
don’t know but it ought to be picked over. (<i>Looks at
watch.</i>) No, I shan’t have time. Of course it’s clean
enough; the floor is swept every day. (<i>Goes out, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>,
with rice; returns.</i>) The next thing is biscuit. That’s
an easy matter. I have only to mix flour and water
together, and put it into the oven. (<i>Pours flour into a
pan, and adds water.</i>) I believe it is customary to
knead it well with the hands. (<i>Puts his hands in, and
stirs ingredients together. At that moment a ring is
heard at the door.</i>) I declare if that isn’t the door-bell.
But I shan’t answer it,—not if they ring a dozen
times.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>who has peeped out of the window, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Papa, it’s
the Ashtons! (<i>An aristocratic family who have never
before called on the <span class="smcap">Smiths.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Is it? (<i>Thinks for a moment; the bell rings
again.</i>) Willie, can’t you go to the door, and show the
ladies into the parlor? Then come out here, and I will
go in and see them. Stop a moment, your face isn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
clean. (<i>The bell rings again.</i>) No matter; come here
and wipe it on my apron. Now go, like a good boy.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Willie</span> goes to answer the bell, but, being a little confused,
shows the visitors into the dining-room, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs.</span>
and <span class="smcap">Miss Ashton</span> look around the room and exchange
significant glances.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>discomposed, takes his hands out of the
dough, and wipes them on his apron</i>). Willie, why did
you bring the ladies into this room? I beg your
pardon, ladies; won’t you go into the parlor? I will be
in directly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> (<i>superciliously</i>). Thank you; but we called
to see Mrs. Smith. Is she at home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> No, she is not. Her sister is dangerously
ill, and has sent for her. She will be at home this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Then we will call again (<i>significantly</i>), at
a more auspicious time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> I trust you will excuse my appearance.
Soon after Mrs. Smith was gone, the servant left me
and—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Ah, yes! I understand—Good morning!
(<i>Aside to her daughter.</i>) What a low family! I shall
not think of calling again.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>provoked</i>). Why didn’t you take those
ladies into the parlor, as I told you, Willie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Willie</span> (<i>terrified</i>). I didn’t mean to, papa. Don’t
scold. I won’t do so again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, see that you don’t. (<i>Soliloquizes.</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
I wonder if I ought to put this bread in another pan before
baking. I guess, however, this one will do just as
well. I’ve got dishes enough to wash already. I must
put this bread into the oven, and look after the rice.
It is fortunate we have some cold meat for dinner, as I
haven’t time to cook any. (<i>Goes out with bread;
returns.</i>) I must pile up those dishes and set the table
for dinner. Then I can wash all the dishes at once.
Who would think that that rice would have swelled so?
There is nearly a peck of it already, and it is still rising.
Half a cup full would have been enough. But, no
matter, we shan’t have to cook any again very soon. I
declare I must go and see to the bread; it must be done
by this time. (<i>Goes out; returns, and finishes setting
the table.</i>) The bread is all done. It didn’t rise much,
and, somehow, I can’t get it out of the pan, but it
seems to have baked well. Perhaps I ought to have
buttered the pan. (<i>Suddenly.</i>) There, I forgot to boil
some potatoes. Well, it can’t be helped. At all
events, we’ve got plenty of rice, and that must take its
place.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p>(<i>He brings in a small dish of meat, the pan of bread,
and afterwards an enormous soup tureen heaped up with
boiled rice. The tureen may be nearly filled up with any
other substance, and the rice placed on top, causing an
observer to think it is entirely filled with rice.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>goes to the door, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and calls</i>). Willie!
Willie! dinner is ready.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>entering</i>). I’m as hungry as a bear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> Well, we’ve got plenty to eat. (<i>Helps him
to meat and rice.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> Isn’t there any potatoes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> No, but here’s some bread. (<i>Tries to cut the
bread, but does not succeed. At that moment the door
opens, and <span class="smcap">Mrs. Smith</span> walks in, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span> She glances at the
table, and bursts into a laugh.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> What <i>have</i> you got for dinner, Mr. Smith?
I think you must be fond of rice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> (<i>rising</i>). Don’t say a word, my dear, don’t
say a word! I’ve had trials enough this morning
to drive a man crazy. Say anything you please about
the drudgery of housework, and I will agree with you.
I’ve had an experience this forenoon which I shall not
forget in a lifetime!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. S.</span> If it causes you to be more considerate in
future, I shall not regret having left you. I think you
must have done something, judging from the appearance
of the room. (<i>Looks around.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. S.</span> And I suppose you think the prospect is,
that there is still something left to do. But as you have
got home so early, I think I’ll go down to the office
a while. I have a slight headache, and think a change
of scene would benefit me.</p>

<span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and her mother, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, present.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Atherton.</span> Did you hear your father say we
were to expect a visitor to-day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche</span> (<i>surprised</i>). No, I heard nothing of it.
Who is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> The daughter of his only sister, who married
a farmer in the little village of Donnellsville.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Do you know anything of her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> No. They live at such a distance, that
there has been but little communication between the
two families. Your father met Mr. Haynes in the city
a few days ago, and invited him to send his daughter
here for a visit. This letter, which he has just received,
announces that she will be here to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Do you know her name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Eunice Haynes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> What a wretchedly countrified name! And
how unfortunate that she should come just at this time.
Next week, you know, we are to have our party, and
of course she will have to be present. I have no doubt
she is a country gawky, whose conversation will be
mostly of “aour caows,” and how much butter and
cheese we make.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> No doubt. I wonder that your father
should have invited her here until some of us had seen
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> As to that, I don’t know how we should ever see
her unless she came here. It will be bad enough to receive
a visit from her, but it would be still worse for
us to visit them. I have no doubt they are genuine
rustics, who keep no servants, talk bad grammar, and
take their meals in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Very likely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> And then I suppose her dresses will all be calico
or gingham, having all the colors of the rainbow.
No doubt she will select the gayest of them all for the
party. How disgusted I am at the thought of this
visit! I wish it were well over.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> So do I. But couldn’t you pass her off as
Isabel’s governess?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> No, that wouldn’t do at all. In fact, she probably
couldn’t sustain that character. Besides, papa
has such strange, out-of-the-way notions on such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
points, that I fear he would be angry if such a thing
were attempted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Perhaps, after all, it may not be as bad as
you think, Blanche. We will wait patiently, and not
judge her till she arrives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> And, by the way, you promised to go out with
me to select a dress for the party. We ought to go
now, I think. Otherwise we shall be obliged to invite

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. B.</span> and <span class="smcap">Blanche</span> enter the other chamber, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, and
lay aside their outer garments.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> I wonder when our rustic friend will arrive?
(<i><span class="smcap">Eunice</span> looks and listens attentively.</i>) I am quite curious
to see her. I suppose she will begin by giving me an
account of all the household matters in particular, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
farm-work in general. I can imagine her dressed in a
rainbow-colored costume, making a deep courtesy to you,
and giving a nod of recognition to your humble servant.
I dare say before night she will tell me confidentially
all about the country swain whom she most favors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Why, Blanche, how you do run on!
Don’t, I beg of you, make her appear any more ridiculous
than she naturally is. And, above all things else,
pray don’t introduce the subject of cows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> I’m sure I don’t see any harm in drawing her
out. It will be so amusing. I will invite her to go
shopping with me to-morrow, just to see how she will
stare in the windows. There will be a slight contrast
between our large and fashionable stores and the one
little variety store in her native village, where they sell
everything from a peck of potatoes to a silk dress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I should be too much mortified to do so.
But she may have arrived already. Let us go down
and see.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exeunt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>astonished and amused</i>). Is it possible that my
aunt and cousin expect to find me so countrified? It
would be cruel in me to disappoint their expectations.
I have always been considered quite good at imitation,
and I have a great mind to personate, for a little while,
the character of a backwood’s maiden—for my amusement
as well us theirs. I must practise a little, first,
in order to carry it out well. (<i>Goes to mirror and
makes a low courtesy.</i>) Why, haow d’ye do, Aunt
Tildy? I’m proper glad to see ye. And haow d’ye<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
do, Blanche? I’m dreadful tickled to meet ye. (<i>Turns
round smiling.</i>) I wonder how it would do to give her
what Charlie calls a “Down East hug.” They would
be fairly horrified, I think. But I will be governed by
circumstances, and go down to meet them without
further delay.</p>

and, stepping forward, bestows a loud kiss upon her
cousin’s cheek. <span class="smcap">Blanche</span>, with a slight frown, takes

Blanche? I’m dreadful tickled to meet ye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). And I am glad to make your acquaintance,
Eunice. When did you leave home?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> Day before yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> You must be quite fatigued (<i><span class="smcap">E.</span> stares</i>)—tired,
perhaps I should say—with your journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> No; I aint tired a mite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Were you ever in the city before?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I guess not. I don’t remember it if I was. It
looks queer enough to see the houses crowded so thick
together. And I haven’t seen a barn since I came. I
suppose, though, they’re all in back of the houses; but
then I don’t see how folks get their caows in and out.
I s’pose they pastur’ ’em on the common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Oh, no, they wouldn’t be allowed in any of the
parks. It is too thickly settled here for any one to
keep cows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> You don’t mean to say that you have to buy all
your butter! It must cost a sight. Why, if I’d a’
known it, I’d have brought you a mess. We churned
the day before I came away, and the butter came tip-top.</p>

<p class="right">(<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> quietly leaves the room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>noticing her aunt’s exit</i>). I s’pose your mother’s
gone out to get tea. If you want to help her, don’t let
me hinder you. And if there’s anything that I can do,
jest let me know, for I’d just as lieves help as not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Thank you, but there’s no need. We leave that
for the servants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> How many helps do you keep?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> There are four, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> And how many have you in family?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Four persons.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>in assumed amazement</i>). Well, that beats all
that ever I heard. What do they all do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> We have a cook, housemaid, chambermaid, and
seamstress, and they all seem to find enough to occupy
their time.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Bell rings.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> What’s that bell for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>rising</i>). That is to call us to dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>rising</i>). What, dinner at six o’clock! At home
we have dinner at twelve, and supper at five. And you
ought to see our bell! Why, you can hear it most half
a mile. We have it to call the men from the field to
their meals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I must admit that she is decidedly rustic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> But did you notice the blunders she made at
dinner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I saw that she ate with her knife, and
didn’t use her napkin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>much amused</i>). That reminds me that when I
took my napkin from the ring, she asked me if I used
a towel in my lap because I was afraid of spoiling my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
dress. She also said that, at home, the younger children
wore bibs, and she wondered we didn’t put one on
to Isabel. (<i>Greatly amused.</i>) Imagine Isabel,—a girl
nine years old, with a bib on!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I’m afraid she wouldn’t submit to it very
quietly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> Then she took butter from the plate with her
own knife, and when pa asked her if she would have
more of the meat, she said, “No; I’ve had enough for
this time.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> I think your father must have noticed her
awkwardness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> I don’t see how he could help it. But he would
not allow her to see that he noticed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> What did she say to the piano? I heard
you playing for her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). She thought it was a queer-looking
thing, and said it must be hard to work it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> Where is she now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> She has retired. She said she always went to
bed as soon as it grew dark. I should think she had
been living in the woods all her life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> And yet, with all her blunders, she is quite
pretty, and dresses with a good deal of taste.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> That is true. And yet, with such an ignorance
of conventional rules, what sort of a figure will she
make at our party?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. A.</span> You will have to make the best of it, and

has never been to the city before. She is fresh from the
country, and I doubt not you will be greatly amused by
her conversation. There she is near the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> You will perhaps laugh at my lack of taste, when
I say that, in my judgment, it does not compare favorably
with the country. City life is too artificial to
satisfy me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> And yet city life has many advantages
which you probably do not get in the country,—lectures,
concerts, and the opera, for example.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I confess these are advantages which I should
be glad to enjoy, and should fully appreciate. In these
latter days, however, most of the lectures are reported
in the papers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Yes, but in reading them one does not get
the full enjoyment that is had in hearing them delivered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> That is true. It is also a great deprivation not
to be able to hear the great singers of the day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. W.</span> Then you are fond of music?</p>

a pause in the conversation and music is called for.

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes. The day of my arrival I was
shown by the servant into the room provided for me.
I had scarcely laid aside my bonnet and shawl when
you and Aunt Matilda came into the chamber adjoining
mine. Unintentionally I overheard you conversing of
me. You both had the impression that, as I lived in
the country, I must be ignorant and uncultivated. I
therefore decided to continue the illusion for a short

time for me to appear in my true character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">B.</span> I am glad that you are not what you seemed.

your talk about pasturing cows in the parks, and so

most of our family died of consumption, and I dare say

<p><span class="smcap">Mary.</span> She went an hour ago, sir. Your sister,

here it is. I will take a teaspoonful. (<i>He takes a

they do. (<i>Begins to cough.</i>) I believe I’ll go into the

time. He gazes at the label, and starts back in terror.</i>)
What’s this? Poison? And I’ve already taken a spoonful
of it! That was what made me feel so strangely.
Oh, I’m a doomed man! (<i>He rings the bell violently,

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Can’t I get you something to take, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>impatiently</i>). Oh, no, no. I’ve taken too
much already. Nothing would help me now. I feel

Why, Lewis, what’s the matter? Are you
sick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> Yes, Susan; not merely sick, but dying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> (<i>perplexed</i>). What can you mean, Lewis?
You left home this morning apparently well, and, after
an hour’s absence, I return to find you nervous and
excited. You look sick, too. Do tell me what is the
cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>excited</i>). That I can very easily do. I was
sick—quite feverish—and had a bad cough, so I
thought I’d take some drops to relieve it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> That was right.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> I went to the closet, and took a spoonful,
and thought they helped me. So, in half an hour, I
went and got some more to take, when I noticed the
label on the bottle, and found that, instead of cough-drops,
I had been taking poison.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> O Lewis, how could you make such a mistake?
(<i>Clasping her hands.</i>) What shall we do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Helen</span> (<i>coolly</i>). Send for the doctor, I should say,
if you haven’t both taken leave of your senses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> Yes, send Mary for the doctor at once.
Why didn’t we think of it sooner?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>dismally</i>). It will do no good. Nothing
can be done now. I feel cold chills passing over me.
I shall not probably be alive when he reaches here. It

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>wearily</i>). Tell him about it, Susan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> It was a terrible mistake, doctor. He intended
to take some cough drops, but, instead, took
some laudanum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> (<i>feeling his pulse</i>). How do you feel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> But those are not the symptoms of poison.

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> More than an hour and a half ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> I don’t believe it was poison at all. I see
no signs of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> But I saw the label.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> Let me see the bottle. (<i><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> brings the

death of you too.</p>

<p>(<i>The doctor lifts the bottle to his lips.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> This is not poison. It is cough-drops, as I
expected. Moreover, it is some that I mixed myself,
and I know there’s no poison in it. But how came that
label on it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> I prepared the label just before I went
away, and told Mary to paste it on the bottle of
laudanum. But it seems she must have pasted it on the
wrong bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). And haven’t I swallowed poison,
after all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G.</span> (<i>dryly</i>). Not unless you’ve taken it from
some other bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. F.</span> How thankful I am that it was a mistake;
aren’t you, Lewis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F.</span> Indeed I am. (<i>A pause.</i>) By the way,
Susan, you might as well hand me back the key of the

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> I don’t see but I’ve got to wear these
clothes, as long as the others are gone, for the convention
meets at nine, and I shan’t have much more’n
time to eat my breakfast. But it beats all where them
other clothes went to, and where these come from.
I declare, I never heard o’ such a thing in my born
days. (<i>He thinks a moment—his face brightens.</i>)
Yes, it must be—there’s no other way. Some of my
friends here in Rossville must ha’ clubbed together, and
bought me this new suit, knowing I was to be here to
the convention. But when could they ha’ brought them
in, and taken my others away, for I’ve had my door
locked ever since I came into the room? Oh, I remember
now, last night, when there was an alarm of fire, I
slipped on my overcoat, and went into the entry to see
where ’twas; but findin’ ’twas a false alarm, I came back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
in less than ten minutes. They must ha’ been dreadful
spry to ha’ made the change so quick. (<i>Apprehensively—taking
up the coat.</i>) I’m afraid they’re too gay for
me, but I seem to be ’bleeged to wear ’em. (<i>Puts on
the vest.</i>) I wonder if the coat fits as well as the rest.
(<i>Puts it on and stands up before the glass, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> Complacently.</i>)
Well, it’s a complete fit, and it does really improve
me amazin’ly—makes me look a good deal
younger. The cloth seems good too. They must ha’
cost a good deal. Really, my friends have been very
kind, but I do wish they’d brought a different hat.
(<i>Puts on the hat, which looks very jaunty for one of his
years.</i>) Perhaps I can exchange it to-morrow, but I’ve
got to wear it to-day, at any rate. There’s one thing I
haven’t thought of afore (<i>feeling in pockets</i>). I wonder
whether they thought to change things in the
pockets from the old to the new. There aint a single
thing in any of ’em. (<i>Irresolutely.</i>) And what shall I
do without money? (<i>Goes quickly to overcoat, and puts
his hand in pocket.</i>) Ah, here is the old wallet.
(<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>) Lucky for me I bought a newspaper
last evening, or that pocket-book would ha’ been
gone too. I must go down and see if I can hear anything
about the rest of the things.</p>

could have been quick enough—aw—to change those
clothes in the five minutes I was out—aw—last night

the thief—aw—that’s all. I guess—aw—he’d never
steal anything else. (<i>A pause. Emphatically.</i>) I
won’t wear this horwid-looking coat (<i>lifting it up.</i>)

that quarter. I don’t see but I’ve got to come to it,
for if I don’t wear these clothes—aw—what shall I
wear? There isn’t any shop that sells ready-made
clothing that I’d be willing to wear—aw—and if there
was I haven’t money enough to spare to buy another
suit. (<i>Groaning.</i>) I don’t see but I <i>must</i> wear it.
(<i>Puts on vest and coat—looks in mirror.</i>) Oh, dear!
Aw—what a fright! And I was going to call on
Arabella Meade this morning. (<i>Puts on hat, which, being
a little too large for him, settles down on the back side

But there’s no use in my going there to-day. The
servants would take me—aw—for a ragamuffin, and
thrust me out of the house—aw—if I attempted to
enter it. I suppose I shall have to go down in this

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> Strange?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. C.</span> No; I thought not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> (<i>a little vexed</i>). If you won’t be in such a
hurry, Dr. Cummings, I’ll explain it all. You see I
came over to Rossville last evening and put up here. I
went to bed early, but about midnight there was a cry
of fire. I slipped on my overcoat, and went into the
entry to learn whether it was near by. In a few minutes
I heard that it was a false alarm. I hurried back to my
room, which I couldn’t have been out of more’n ten minutes,
and locked my door. Then I went to bed and to
sleep. When I waked in the morning my old clothes,
which have done me such faithful service, were gone,
and these were left in their place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. C.</span> How do you suppose they came there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> It is my opinion that my friends in Rossville,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>

this way of presenting me with a new and fashionable
suit of clothes.</p>

gone stark, staring mad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> (<i>anxiously</i>). Stop, Reeny, I’ll explain it all.
My friends in Rossville came and brought me this suit
in the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. R.</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>). Fiddlestick! Do you
expect me to believe that ridiculous story? I’m really
afraid you’ve been drinking. Nothing else could ha’
brought you to make such a fool of yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). Mrs. Robinson, I command you
to be silent. It’s you that are makin’ a fool o’ yourself,
I’d have you to know. It’s enough for you to
think of your own dress, and not interfere with mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. H.</span> But there can’t be any mistake; don’t you
see—aw—he’s got on my clothes, and I his?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Yes; but if he intended to steal them
he wouldn’t come in, and sit quietly in the parlor with
the garments on. But I haven’t heard how it came
about. Did either of you leave your room last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">F. H.</span> I only left it for five minutes—aw—when
the alarm of fire was raised—aw—and this morning
when I waked—aw—my new suit was changed into
these horwid things. (<i>Glances with contempt upon them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L.</span> (<i>to <span class="smcap">Deacon</span></i>). And did you leave your room, too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R</span>. Yes; but only long enough to go into the
entry and back again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L.</span> I see how it is; your rooms were side by side.
You both left them, and when you returned, you each
went into the other’s room. That accounts for the
change of clothing. (<i>One policeman beckons to the other,
and they go out, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dea. R.</span> By George, that must ha’ been the way
’twas done. But I declare to goodness, I never should
ha’ thought about it. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Landlord</span>.</i>) Thank you,
landlord, for gettin’ me out o’ this scrape. (<i>To <span class="smcap">Fitz

go up stairs and swap clothes again. I guess these

present, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>entering room, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, with boots in his hand</i>). It’s
most time for me to go to the store, Mary. (<i>Sits down,
<span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, and puts on boots.</i>) I declare it’s astonishing how
soon eight o’clock comes these short mornings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary</span> (<i>who is dusting the room</i>). It brings to mind
the mornings, in the days gone by, when you were
obliged to go to school, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Yes; and I can’t say I enjoy one any more than
the other. It’s about as disagreeable as leaving a nice,
cosey fire on a winter’s night and getting into a cold
bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> But then I think one appreciates his home more,
and enjoys the time he is able to pass in it more fully,
than if he remained at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Perhaps you are right, Mary; but I shouldn’t
object to try the other way for awhile. (<i>Tosses slippers
under the sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> John, dear, hadn’t you better put your slippers
in their place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Oh, we’ll consider this their place. Then I
shan’t have to go searching after them to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> There won’t be any need of <i>searching</i> for them.
If you put them where they belong, they will be sure to
remain there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> But it’s a great bother to go out of one’s way for
such trifles. They’re much handier lying there, and
will be all ready for me to put on to-night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> But life is made up of trifles, and leaving things
round clutters up the room so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Why, no; a thing looks as well in one place as
another. Besides, what’s the use of having a house if
you can’t keep things where you want to? But there
(<i>pushing them still farther under the sofa with his foot</i>),
they’re out of sight now. They will be handy, and no
one will be the wiser for their being there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> But I have to go around every day and pick
things up after you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Oh, well, don’t pick them up; just let them stay
where they are, and then I can find them when I want
them. (<i>Takes up overcoat from chair, where he had left it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>

exit, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>alone</i>). Something must be done to cure John
of this careless habit of leaving things around; but how
it can be arranged, I cannot tell yet. I must think it
over.</p>

and <span class="smcap">Mary</span> enter, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aunt Rebecca.</span> And you have married since I saw
you last; married happily, I hope. (<i>They sit down, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Yes; I couldn’t wish for a kinder or pleasanter
husband. But between you and me, Aunt Rebecca, he
has one fault that distresses me exceedingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> And what is that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> He is so careless about his things. You have
only to look about you, and you will see at once what I
mean. I haven’t been in this room until now since he
went to the store this morning. There are (<i>looking at
each as she speaks</i>) two hats, two coats, dressing-gown,
vest and slippers lying around. He is in such a hurry
when he goes away, that he doesn’t notice anything
about it, and when he comes home, I have put them all
in their places, so I don’t think he realizes what an untidy
appearance the room presents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> That <i>is</i> rather a disagreeable habit. Have
you spoken to him about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Spoken? Yes; I’ve delivered whole
lectures on the subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> And what does he say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Oh, he makes light of it, and manages to change
the subject whenever it is brought up. I don’t like to
spoil the peace of our cosey home by scolding, but I feel
as if something must be done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> I see how it is, Mary. You must declare
war.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>looking up surprised</i>). In what way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> I haven’t fully matured a plan yet, but we
will open the campaign to-night, and, my word for it, if
you follow my directions, you will come off victorious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I am filled with curiosity to know how it is all to
come about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Servant</span> (<i>entering, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>) A littir for you, ma’am.
(<i>Passes letter to <span class="smcap">M.</span> and exit, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mary</span> reads the
letter.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> It is a line from John, saying that he will bring
his friend, Mr. Hastings, home to dine with us. I suppose
he thought it possible I might be out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> What kind of a man is Mr. Hastings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Very pleasant indeed, and as fond of a good
joke as any one I know of. He and John are great
friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> Then it will be just the time for us to open
the campaign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> You have it all arranged, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A. R.</span> Yes; draw your chair this way, and I will
explain it to you. (<i><span class="smcap">Mary</span> moves near <span class="smcap">A. R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John</span> (<i>glancing in surprise, first around the room, then

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Oh, no. (<i>Turns to greet his companion.</i>) I’m
glad to see you, Mr. Hastings. Sit down, do. (<i>Takes
coat from chair, and tosses it carelessly on sofa.</i>) You
haven’t been here for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edwin</span> (<i>looking round with an amused smile</i>). It <i>is</i>
a long time for me to be away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>taking <span class="smcap">M.’s</span> shawl and bonnet from easy-chair</i>.)
Say, Mary, what shall I do with these dry-goods?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Oh, lay them on the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> But there isn’t room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Isn’t there? Well, put them on the piano.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> But I was just going to open it, so that we might
have some music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Well, put them on the sofa, then. There’s certainly
room enough there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> But some one may sit on them there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> I guess not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>glancing uneasily around</i>). Hadn’t you better
pick up things a little, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>carelessly</i>). Oh, no, just let them lie as they are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> But they look so bad. And you know we frequently
have callers in the evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Oh, they don’t look bad. I don’t see but a thing
looks as well in one place as another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I never saw your room look like this before,
Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>apparently surprised</i>). Didn’t you? But I
thought we might as well keep things handy. What’s
the use of having a house, if you can’t keep things where
you want to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Oh, that’s it. So you’re giving an imitation of
me, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). I’ve tried to. But don’t you like it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> No, I don’t; that’s a fact.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M.</span> Well, then, if you’ll agree not to do so again,
I’ll straighten up the room; but if you have a relapse,
mind, I shall have one, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Oh, I shan’t; don’t fear. If I’m in danger of it,
the recollection of this scene will bring me back to the
paths of rectitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> (<i>coming forward, and bowing with mock deference</i>).
I congratulate you, on the success of your
scheme, Mrs. Marden, and have no doubt it will prove
efficacious. It is worth a dozen scoldings, and is a far
more agreeable remedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>exultantly</i>). I rather think it touches you a little,
old fellow, too, judging from the appearance of your
bachelor apartments when I have called there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">E.</span> I am sure of that, and have taken a part of it to
myself already. When next you come to my rooms,
you will, without doubt, be struck with the transformation,
and will perceive at once, that I, as well as yourself
have profited by Mrs. Marden’s lesson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> You must have a very vivid imagination to suppose
one of my dignity (<i>straightening himself up</i>) would
descend to such trifles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom.</span> One of <i>your</i> dignity! That’s a good one. But
come now, Dick, do tell us if anything is going on.
It’s been the perfection of dulness here for the last
three weeks. Any change would be welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>dryly</i>). Does your last remark refer to your
pockets, or some other part of your habiliments?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T.</span> (<i>smiling</i>). Apply it where you choose. But come,
you’ve got some plan, I know. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> You are right, boys, I <i>have</i> got a plan. But remember
(<i>impressively</i>), it must be a profound secret with
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Walter.</span> We are willing to make the most solemn

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Joe Sherman.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> Good! What’s the programme?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> He is to have his fortune told. (<i>The boys crowd
around <span class="smcap">Dick</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>). How is it to be done?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Perhaps you have learned that Madame Devineresse,
the fortune-teller, is stopping at the Everett
House. It wouldn’t be very difficult for her to flatter
Joe into the belief that he was born for some great and
glorious end.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> He’s satisfied on that point, already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> But you don’t understand. We will give her
some hints of what he will expect, and then can have
the fun of listening to the whole performance, and be
better prepared to enjoy his remarks about it afterward.
I have had a little conversation with Madame Devineresse,
and I feel sure she will consent to co-operate
with us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T.</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). I’ll wager an inkstand that Dick’s
already had his fortune told by madame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> That’s nothing strange. He has had it told by
every fortune-teller that’s visited the town for the last
two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>coolly</i>). What difference does that make, when
every one tells a different story? A fellow must have
some excitement in a little country village like this.
Of course I don’t believe a word said by any one of
them. But Sherman would. He’s just one of that
kind. If she told him anything he wished to believe,
he would put implicit faith in it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">W.</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>). I don’t know about that.
Joe is pretty cunning. I wouldn’t be a bit surprised
if he should discover the plot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Trust me for that. I’ve got things arranged so
it is impossible he could suspect anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">T.</span> When is it to come off?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> This evening, at the rooms of Madame Devineresse.
We are to be concealed in the ante-room, and
hear all that is said. It will be rich, I assure you.
Come to my room at seven o’clock, and we will be ready
to follow him. He will be there by half-past seven.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">H.</span> How do you know he is going at all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> I don’t expect he is thinking of it at present;
but I must plan some way to induce him to go, and to
be there at that hour. So I must leave you now. Don’t
fail to be on hand at the appointed time.</p>

which has placed you, though young, in the front ranks
of your profession. Envious persons have maligned
you, and opponents assailed you; but, without deigning
to notice them, you have steadily gone on, till you have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
attained a high position in the profession which you
adorn.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> again takes the mirror. Taking a box from
the table, she shakes on the surface of the mirror a white
powder. Wiping it carefully, she makes passes over it
with her wand, and hands it to the young man. He
gazes upon it for a moment in silence, and with pleased
wonder. <span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> looks on benignantly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> The picture pleases you, then. What
does the mirror disclose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I see a beautiful house. On the balcony a gentleman
is standing. He is addressing a throng of people
who are assembled before the house. They wave
their hats, and are full of enthusiasm. What does it
mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> Do you not recognize the gentleman?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> It looks like myself, but cannot be, for it is too
old.</p>

<p>(<i><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> takes the mirror, and gazes on it for a
moment.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> It does look somewhat older, and more mature.
But why should it not? It represents you as you
will appear <i>thirty</i> years hence. You have steadily pressed
onward, distancing all with whom you started at school.
You have just been elected as member of Congress, and
the people, wild with enthusiasm, are shouting your
name, and calling for a speech. (<i><span class="smcap">Joe</span> gazes, as if spellbound,
on the mirror.</i>) Are you satisfied with the
glimpses of the future which I have given you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>with dignity befitting his future position, and,
returning the mirror to her</i>). Yes, my good woman, you
have done very well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> There are few persons to whom such a
brilliant future opens. Whenever the glass has mirrored
such scenes as I have shown you, it loses power ever
after to delineate scenes in <i>common</i> lives. I therefore
present it to you, that, when depressed by the trials of
life, you may gain courage by gazing at its magic surface.
I will place it in a box, in which it must always
be kept. Otherwise, it will lose all its power.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span></i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>pacing back and forth</i>). And this is to be the
end of my career! No, not the end, for I may yet become
President. I wonder what Harry, Dick, and
Walter would say, if they knew what I do. They
have always thought I put on airs; but they will, some
time, realize that it was only my natural dignity, which
could not fail to assert its superiority to the common
herd around me. (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span>, with box, which she
hands to <span class="smcap">Joe</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. D.</span> Here is the precious mirror. (<i><span class="smcap">J.</span> takes it.</i>)
Handle it carefully. When not in use, on no account
leave it out of the box. It is capable of producing
other scenes in your life than those which I have shown
you. Whenever you wish to test it, you have but to
wipe its surface carefully, wave your hand over it three
times, and it will produce your image and surroundings
more faithfully than they have yet been shown you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> Thank you, madame, for your great, your inestimable
gift. I will guard it sacredly, and, when I become
famous and powerful, I will reward you as you deserve.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Curtain falls.</i>)</p>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene III.</span>—<i><span class="smcap">Dick’s</span> room. <span class="smcap">Joe</span> enters, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> He goes to
table, <span class="allsmcap">C.</span>, and takes up book.</i></p>

</div><p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>solus</i>). I thought I should find a dictionary
<i>here</i>. Dick told me this morning I was the most
“stultiloquent orator” he ever listened to. I never
heard the word before, but it has quite a grand sound,
and I mean to use it the first chance I get, but I want
to know its meaning. (<i>Turns over the leaves, and finds
between them a letter not yet folded.</i>) Hallo, what’s
this? (<i>Takes up letter.</i>) A letter to Tim Bellamy.
How I’d <i>like</i> to read it! But then it wouldn’t be just the
thing. (<i>Glances towards bottom of sheet.</i>) What’s
this? (<i>Reads.</i>) “Now I tell you how we duped Joe
Sherman.” Why, that’s me. I must find out about
that. (<i>Sits down and reads.</i>) “You know Joe is one
of the most conceited boys in school. Well, some of
us fellows thought we’d have a little fun at his expense
through this failing. I heard, one evening, that a
fortune-teller had arrived at the hotel. You know I
always had a weakness for having my fortune told. So
I went to see her, and finding her very pleasant and
obliging, I arranged with her to tell Joe’s fortune in a
way that would tickle his vanity. As I agreed to pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
her for it, she was nothing loth to do her part, and she
did it well. Several of us fellows were in the next room,
and heard all that was said. She flattered him with
glimpses of the future which raised his opinion of himself
so much that, since then, he carries his head like a
peer of the realm. By the way, these glimpses
of the future were had by looking into a seven-by-nine
mirror, which reflected pictures hung up
behind Joe, and which we changed each time
he looked into it. We enjoyed, hugely, listening
to the interview, as I think we ought, for it took three
of us several hours to draw the three pictures. It was
also quite a tax on the imagination, which had to be
stretched to the utmost to make Joe satisfied with his
fortune. But we were successful. I can’t help laughing
when I think how carefully he carried that little
mirror home, promising to guard it sacredly. The
fortune-teller told him that when next he looked in it
it would reflect his image even more faithfully than it
had yet done. I wonder what he thought when he <i>did</i>
look in it and saw nothing but his own homely countenance
just as it was?” (<i>Puts back letter and closes the
book.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>solus</i>). Well, that’s the meanest thing I ever knew
Dick to do. I wonder who were with him; Harry and
Tom most likely. But Dick was the ringleader. He
always is. The idea of my being made such a laughing
stock! (<i>Paces back and forth.</i>) It was the climax of
meanness. But I’ll turn the table on them. I guess<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
Nat and I are capable of planning something which will
pay up old scores. We’ll have a consultation to-night,
for I want it done before Dick sends his letter, so he
can not only tell the story of his exploit, but also give
the sequel. (<i>A noise is heard, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span></i>) Ah, somebody’s
coming; I mustn’t be seen here.</p>

<p class="right">(<i>Exit, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span> Curtain falls.</i>)</p>

<div class="scene">

<p><span class="smcap">Scene IV.</span>—<i>Same as Scene II. The room is darkened.
In the background is placed a large screen, from
behind which—whenever they can escape observation—several
boys peer out. Enter <span class="smcap">Dick</span>, <span class="allsmcap">R.</span>, with an
open letter. He advances to <span class="allsmcap">R. C.</span></i></p>

</div><p><span class="smcap">D.</span> I don’t see who could have sent me this notice.
The handwriting is evidently that of a lady. Possibly
it is that of Mme. Marie herself. But the puzzle is,
how she happened to send it to me. I suppose, though,
some one informed her that I liked to have my fortune
told occasionally. (<i>Reads.</i>)
“Madame Marie, the veiled prophetess of the East,
respectfully gives notice that she has taken up her
residence at Number 27 Osborne Street, where she will
remain for seven days only, during which time she is
willing to unfold the future of those who may wish to
become acquainted with its secrets. Madame Marie
will disclose the mysteries of the past, as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
hidden events of the future. As her stay is of limited
duration, those wishing to consult her will do well to
call at once.” (<i>Places note in his pocket and paces back
and forth with his hands clasped behind him.</i>) I received
this note only an hour ago, and hastened to call
upon her. But although I have been here full fifteen
minutes, I have as yet seen no one. Where <i>is</i>
Madame Marie? (<i>Enter <span class="smcap">Mme. Marie</span>, <span class="allsmcap">L.</span>, shrouded
with a black veil.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. Marie</span> (<i>in measured tones.</i>) She is here.
What would you have? Shall I tell you the past, or only
the future?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> I would hear something of the past as well as of
the future, if you please, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. M.</span> That is well. I will consult the oracles,
and give you their testimony. (<i>A pause. <span class="smcap">Dick</span> looks
expectant.</i>) Ah, yes, the events of our past life come
crowding up before me. I see that you are credulous,
impulsive, and somewhat superstitious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> Credulous and superstitious! Oh, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. M.</span> (<i>waving her hand</i>). Silence. It is not
meet that you interrupt the disclosures of the oracles.
Superstition signifies a fondness for the unknown and
mysterious; therefore you are superstitious. You are
also credulous; for did you not believe the revelations
of Madame Devineresse, who came here a short time
ago, and who is an arrant impostor? You were the
means of bringing to her a young man who wished to
look into the magic mirror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>smiling at the recollection</i>). Yes, and he went
away with higher aspirations, and a feeling of inward
pleasure which cannot be described. I think praise
rather than blame is due me for this deed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. M.</span> I need not tell you of the deception which
you practised on him. Even now circumstances are at
work which will bring to you direful consequences on
account of that deed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>somewhat troubled</i>). What do you mean? Has
he discovered the trick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. M.</span> (<i>without heeding him</i>). I see the young
man standing before a tall, stern-looking person. The
young man is talking earnestly, but I cannot hear his
words. The tall man listens attentively, and soon the
young man goes out. The tall man seems angry.
Hark! he speaks: “So this is the way the boys spend
the hours they should be employed in study. No wonder
recitations are poor. But it is fortunate that I have
discovered the cause in such good time. I will make
an example of this case, and will inflict on the chief
offender such a severe punishment that it will strike
terror into the hearts of the remainder of the school.
What shall it be? Ha! I have it. John, bring me a
strong rope, and a couple of good willow switches.
Then call together the scholars.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>in a fever of excitement</i>). Is there no way of
avoiding this punishment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mme. M.</span> (<i>unheeding him</i>). I see the scholars crowding
into the room, but there is one of them who cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
be found. No one knows where he is gone. Now a
note is handed to the tall man. He nods approvingly,
and tells all the scholars to follow him. Ha, they come
this way! They are at the door! They enter! (<i>She
starts back, and the boys from behind the screen come
noisily forward. They surround <span class="smcap">Madame M.</span> <span class="smcap">Dick</span> is
in a state of great excitement.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nat.</span> Hooray for the great fortune-teller, Madame
Marie! (<i>Pulls off her veil and cloak, disclosing the features
and figure of <span class="smcap">Joe Sherman</span>.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> (<i>comes forward smiling</i>). Is your fortune satisfactory,
Dick?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> (<i>confused</i>). I don’t know. Let me see. (<i>Recovering
himself.</i>) Yes, very much so. It’s turned out far
different from what I expected, a moment ago. I
anticipated a more tragic and <i>striking</i> close. (<i>Comes
forward, and takes <span class="smcap">Joe’s</span> hand.</i>) We’re quits now, Joe.
I give you credit for turning the tables on me completely.
But henceforth I shall keep clear of fortune-tellers.
They are great humbugs, as I have had ample opportunity
to know. Besides, it would be far more sensible
for us boys to plan our future ourselves, and then try
to live up to it, than to listen to the idle talk of those
who care for nothing but the money of their victims.
Now, Joe, I challenge you to enter the list with me, to
gain the prize offered for the greatest number of perfect
recitations during this term. What do you say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">J.</span> I’ll do it, Dick. I’ll <i>try</i> for the prize, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">D.</span> That’s it, old fellow. And whichever is successful,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
the progress we have made will stimulate us to
strive for still higher honors. And who knows but we
may yet gain as great distinction as was pictured to
you by Madame Devineresse, in the Magic Mirror?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
